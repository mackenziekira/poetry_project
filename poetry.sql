1	Rosa Parks	1		\nThis is for the Pullman Porters who organized when people said\r\nthey couldn’t. And carried the Pittsburgh Courier and the ChicagoDefender to the Black Americans in the South so they would\r\nknow they were not alone. This is for the Pullman Porters who\r\nhelped Thurgood Marshall go south and come back north to fight\r\nthe fight that resulted in Brown v. Board of Education because\r\neven though Kansas is west and even though Topeka is the birth-\nplace of Gwendolyn Brooks, who wrote the powerful “The\r\nChicago Defender Sends a Man to Little Rock,” it was the\r\nPullman Porters who whispered to the traveling men both\r\nthe Blues Men and the “Race” Men so that they both would\r\nknow what was going on. This is for the Pullman Porters who\r\nsmiled as if they were happy and laughed like they were tickled\r\nwhen some folks were around and who silently rejoiced in 1954\r\nwhen the Supreme Court announced its 9—0 decision that “sepa-\r\nrate is inherently unequal.” This is for the Pullman Porters who\r\nsmiled and welcomed a fourteen-year-old boy onto their train in\r\n1955. They noticed his slight limp that he tried to disguise with a\r\ndoo-wop walk; they noticed his stutter and probably understood\r\nwhy his mother wanted him out of Chicago during the summer\r\nwhen school was out. Fourteen-year-old Black boys with limps\r\nand stutters are apt to try to prove themselves in dangerous ways\r\nwhen mothers aren’t around to look after them. So this is for the\r\nPullman Porters who looked over that fourteen-year-old while\r\nthe train rolled the reverse of the Blues Highway from Chicago to\r\nSt. Louis to Memphis to Mississippi. This is for the men who kept\r\nhim safe; and if Emmett Till had been able to stay on a train all\r\nsummer he would have maybe grown a bit of a paunch, certainly\r\nlost his hair, probably have worn bifocals and bounced his grand-\r\nchildren on his knee telling them about his summer riding the\r\nrails. But he had to get off the train. And ended up in Money,\r\nMississippi. And was horribly, brutally, inexcusably, and unac-\r\nceptably murdered. This is for the Pullman Porters who, when the\r\nsheriff was trying to get the body secretly buried, got Emmett’s\r\nbody on the northbound train, got his body home to Chicago,\r\nwhere his mother said: I want the world to see what they did\r\nto my boy. And this is for all the mothers who cried. And this is\r\nfor all the people who said Never Again. And this is about Rosa\r\nParks whose feet were not so tired, it had been, after all, an ordi-\r\nnary day, until the bus driver gave her the opportunity to make\r\nhistory. This is about Mrs. Rosa Parks from Tuskegee, Alabama,\r\nwho was also the field secretary of the NAACP. This is about the\r\nmoment Rosa Parks shouldered her cross, put her worldly goods\r\naside, was willing to sacrifice her life, so that that young man in\r\nMoney, Mississippi, who had been so well protected by the\r\nPullman Porters, would not have died in vain. When Mrs. Parks\r\nsaid “NO” a passionate movement was begun. No longer would\r\nthere be a reliance on the law; there was a higher law. When Mrs.\r\nParks brought that light of hers to expose the evil of the system,\r\nthe sun came and rested on her shoulders bringing the heat and\r\nthe light of truth. Others would follow Mrs. Parks. Four young\r\nmen in Greensboro, North Carolina, would also say No. Great\r\nvoices would be raised singing the praises of God and exhorting\r\nus “to forgive those who trespass against us.” But it was the\r\nPullman Porters who safely got Emmett to his granduncle and it\r\nwas Mrs. Rosa Parks who could not stand that death. And in not\r\nbeing able to stand it. She sat back down.\n	'0':164 '1954':156 '1955':192 '9':163 'abl':309,658 'alabama':482 'alon':39 'also':485,606 'american':28 'announc':161 'apt':242 'aren':253 'around':150,255 'asid':506 'back':54,664 'begun':546 'bifoc':334 'birth':80 'bit':323 'black':27,235 'blue':111,283 'board':65 'bodi':389,395,402 'bounc':336 'boy':187,236,421 'bring':585 'brook':84 'brought':565 'brown':63 'brutal':368 'buri':391 'bus':465 'came':579 'carolina':604 'carri':18 'ceptabl':372 'certain':327 'chicago':90,223,286,405 'chicagodefend':24 'children':339 'come':53 'could':649 'couldn':15 'courier':21 'court':160 'cri':430 'cross':501 'danger':249 'day':462 'death':653 'decis':165 'defend':91 'die':534 'disguis':202 'doo':206 'doo-wop':205 'driver':466 'educ':67 'emmett':305,393,638 'end':360 'even':69,75 'evil':573 'exhort':620 'expos':571 'feet':449 'field':487 'fight':57,59 'folk':148 'follow':595 'forgiv':623 'four':598 'fourteen':184,232,272 'fourteen-year-old':183,231,271 'gave':467 'get':355,387 'go':50,125 'god':618 'good':505 'got':392,400,637 'grand':338 'granduncl':641 'great':609 'greensboro':602 'grown':321 'gwendolyn':83 'hair':330 'happi':139 'heat':587 'help':47 'higher':560 'highway':284 'histori':473 'home':403 'horribl':367 'inexcus':369 'inher':170 'kansa':71 'kept':300 'knee':342 'know':35,122 'laugh':141 'law':556,561 'life':512 'light':567,590 'like':142 'limp':197,238 'littl':96 'longer':548 'look':257,268 'lost':328 'loui':289 'make':472 'man':94,517 'marshal':49 'mayb':320 'memphi':291 'men':108,112,116,298,600 'mississippi':293,364,520 'moment':496 'money':363,519 'mother':218,252,408,428 'movement':544 'mrs':477,538,563,596,645 'murder':373 'naacp':491 'nari':461 'never':440 'north':55,603 'northbound':398 'notic':194,210 'old':186,234,274 'onto':188 'opportun':470 'ordi':460 'organ':10 'other':593 'park':2,447,479,498,539,564,597,647 'passion':543 'paunch':326 'peopl':12,437 'pittsburgh':20 'place':81 'porter':8,45,102,132,177,266,379,530,634 'power':88 'prais':616 'probabl':214,331 'protect':526 'prove':246 'pullman':7,44,101,131,176,265,378,529,633 'put':502 'race':115 'rail':350 'rais':613 'rate':168 'rejoic':154 'relianc':553 'rest':581 'result':61 'revers':280 'ride':348 'rock':97 'roll':278 'rosa':1,446,478,497,646 'sacrific':510 'safe':302,636 'said':13,409,439,540 'sat':663 'say':607 'school':228 'secret':390 'secretari':488 'see':415 'send':92 'sepa':167 'sheriff':383 'shoulder':499,584 'silent':153 'sing':614 'slight':196 'smile':134,179 'south':31,51 'st':288 'stand':651,660 'stay':311 'stutter':212,240 'summer':226,316,347 'sun':578 'suprem':159 'system':576 'tell':343 'though':70,76 'thurgood':48 'tickl':145 'till':306 'tire':453 'topeka':77 'train':190,277,314,358,399 'travel':107 'trespass':626 'tri':200,244,385 'truth':592 'tuskege':481 'unac':371 'understood':215 'unequ':171 'us':621,628 'v':64 'vain':536 'voic':610 'walk':208 'want':219,411 'way':250 'welcom':181 'well':525 'west':73 'whisper':104 'whose':448 'will':508 'wop':207 'world':413,504 'worn':333 'would':34,121,318,531,549,594,605,611 'wrote':86 'year':185,233,273 'young':516,599

4	Translations	2		\nI want to believe we can’t see anything\r we don’t have a word for.\r  \r When I look out the window and say green, I mean sea green,\r I mean moss green, I mean gray, I mean pale and also\r electrically flecked with white and I mean green\r in its damp way of glowing off a leaf.\r  \r Scheele’s green, the green of Renaissance painters,\r is a sodium carbonate solution heated to ninety degrees\r as arsenious oxide is stirred in. Sodium displaces copper,\r resulting in a green precipitate that is sometimes used\r as insecticide. When I say green I mean\r a shiny green bug eating a yellow leaf.\r  \r Before synthetics, not every painter could afford a swathe\r of blue. Shocking pink, aka neon, aka kinky pink,\r wasn’t even on the market. I want to believe Andy Warhol\r invented it in 1967 and ever since no one’s eyes\r have been the same. There were sunsets before,\r but without that hot shocking neon Marilyn, a desert sky\r was just cataract smears. I want to believe this.\r  \r The pale green of lichen and half-finished leaves\r filling my window is a palette very far from carnation\r or bougainvillea, but to look out is to understand it is not,\r is to understand what it is not. I stare out the window a lot.\r Between the beginning and the end the leaves unfolded.\r I looked out one morning and everything was unfamiliar\r as if I was looking at the green you could only see\r if you’d never known synthetic colors existed.\r  \r I’ve drawn into myself people say.\r We understand, they say.\r  \r There are people who only have words for red\r and black and white, and I wonder if they even see\r the trees at the edge of the grass\r or the green storms coming out of the west.\r There are people who use the same word for green\r and red and brown, and I wonder if red\r seems so urgently bright pouring from the body\r when there is no green for it to fall against.\r  \r In his treatise on color Wittgenstein asked,\r “Can’t we imagine certain people\r having a different geometry of colour than we do?”\r  \r I want to believe the eye doesn’t see green until it has a name,\r because I don’t want anything to look the way it did before.\r  \r Van Gogh painted pink flowers, but the pink faded\r and curators labeled the work “White Roses” by mistake.\r  \r The world in my window is a color the Greeks called chlorol.\r When I learned the word I was newly pregnant\r and the first pale lichens had just speckled the silver branches.\r The pines and the lichens in the chill drizzle were glowing green\r and a book in my lap said chlorol was one of the untranslatable\r words. The vibrating glow pleased me then, as a finger\r dipped in sugar pleased me then. I said the word aloud\r for the baby to hear. Chlorol. I imagined the baby\r could only see hot pink and crimson inside its tiny universe,\r but if you can see what I’m seeing, the word for it\r is chlorol. It’s one of the things you’ll like out here.\r  \r Nineteenth century critics mocked painters who cast shadows\r in unexpected colors. After noticing green cypresses do drop red\r shadows, Goethe chastised them. “The eye demands\r completeness and seeks to eke out the colorific circle in itself.”\r He tells of a trick of light that had him pacing a row of poppies\r to see the flaming petals again and figure out why.\r  \r Over and over again Wittgenstein frets the problem of translucence.\r Why is there no clear white?\r He wants to see the world through white-tinted glasses,\r but all he finds is mist.\r  \r At first I felt as if the baby had fallen away\r like a blue shadow on the snow.\r  \r Then I felt like I killed the baby\r in the way you can be thinking about something else\r and drop a heavy platter by mistake.\r  \r Sometimes I feel like I was stupid\r to have thought I was pregnant at all.\r  \r Color is an illusion, a response to the vibrating universe\r of electrons. Light strikes a leaf and there’s an explosion\r where it lands. When colors change, electromagnetic fields\r are colliding. The wind is not the only thing moving the trees.\r  \r Once when I went into those woods I saw a single hot pink orchid\r on the hillside and I had to keep reminding myself not to\r tell the baby about the beautiful small things I was seeing.\r So, hot pink has been here forever and I don’t even care\r about that color or how Andy Warhol showed me an orchid.\r I hate pink. It makes my eyes burn.\n	'1967':144 'afford':117 'aka':124,126 'aloud':493 'also':42 'andi':139,789 'anyth':10,390 'arsenious':78 'ask':354 'away':645 'babi':496,503,642,660,762 'beauti':765 'begin':227 'believ':5,138,177,373 'black':284 'blue':121,648 'bodi':337 'book':462 'bougainvillea':200 'branch':447 'bright':333 'brown':324 'bug':106 'burn':802 'call':426 'carbon':71 'care':783 'carnat':198 'cast':547 'cataract':172 'centuri':542 'certain':359 'chang':719 'chastis':561 'chill':455 'chlorol':427,467,499,529 'circl':574 'clear':616 'collid':723 'color':261,352,423,551,693,718,786 'colorif':573 'colour':366 'come':306 'complet':566 'copper':85 'could':116,252,504 'crimson':510 'critic':543 'curat':408 'cypress':555 'd':257 'damp':53 'degre':76 'demand':565 'desert':168 'differ':363 'dip':483 'displac':84 'doesn':376 'drawn':265 'drizzl':456 'drop':557,672 'eat':107 'edg':298 'eke':570 'electr':43 'electromagnet':720 'electron':704 'els':670 'end':230 'even':131,292,782 'ever':146 'everi':114 'everyth':240 'exist':262 'explos':713 'eye':151,375,564,801 'fade':406 'fall':346 'fallen':644 'far':196 'feel':680 'felt':638,655 'field':721 'figur':599 'fill':189 'find':632 'finger':482 'finish':187 'first':439,636 'flame':595 'fleck':44 'flower':402 'forev':777 'fret':607 'geometri':364 'glass':628 'glow':56,458,476 'goeth':560 'gogh':399 'grass':301 'gray':37 'greek':425 'green':26,30,34,50,62,64,89,100,105,181,250,304,320,342,379,459,554 'half':186 'half-finish':185 'hate':796 'hear':498 'heat':73 'heavi':674 'hillsid':750 'hot':163,507,745,772 'illus':696 'imagin':358,501 'insecticid':96 'insid':511 'invent':141 'keep':755 'kill':658 'kinki':127 'known':259 'label':409 'land':716 'lap':465 'leaf':59,110,708 'learn':430 'leav':188,232 'lichen':183,441,452 'light':583,705 'like':538,646,656,681 'll':537 'look':20,203,235,247,392 'lot':224 'm':522 'make':799 'marilyn':166 'market':134 'mean':28,32,36,39,49,102 'mist':634 'mistak':415,677 'mock':544 'morn':238 'moss':33 'move':731 'name':384 'neon':125,165 'never':258 'newli':435 'nineteenth':541 'nineti':75 'notic':553 'one':149,237,469,532 'orchid':747,794 'oxid':79 'pace':587 'paint':400 'painter':67,115,545 'pale':40,180,440 'palett':194 'peopl':268,276,313,360 'petal':596 'pine':449 'pink':123,128,401,405,508,746,773,797 'platter':675 'pleas':477,486 'poppi':591 'pour':334 'precipit':90 'pregnant':436,690 'problem':609 'red':282,322,329,558 'remind':756 'renaiss':66 'respons':698 'result':86 'rose':413 'row':589 'said':466,490 'saw':742 'say':25,99,269,273 'scheel':60 'sea':29 'see':9,254,293,378,506,519,523,593,621,770 'seek':568 'seem':330 'shadow':548,559,649 'shini':104 'shock':122,164 'show':791 'silver':446 'sinc':147 'singl':744 'sky':169 'small':766 'smear':173 'snow':652 'sodium':70,83 'solut':72 'someth':669 'sometim':93,678 'speckl':444 'stare':219 'stir':81 'storm':305 'strike':706 'stupid':684 'sugar':485 'sunset':158 'swath':119 'synthet':112,260 'tell':578,760 'thing':535,730,767 'think':667 'thought':687 'tini':513 'tint':627 'translat':1 'transluc':611 'treatis':350 'tree':295,733 'trick':581 'understand':207,213,271 'unexpect':550 'unfamiliar':242 'unfold':233 'univers':514,702 'untranslat':472 'urgent':332 'use':94,315 'van':398 've':264 'vibrat':475,701 'want':3,136,175,371,389,619 'warhol':140,790 'wasn':129 'way':54,394,663 'went':737 'west':310 'white':46,286,412,617,626 'white-tint':625 'wind':725 'window':23,191,222,420 'without':161 'wittgenstein':353,606 'wonder':289,327 'wood':740 'word':16,280,318,432,473,492,525 'work':411 'world':417,623 'yellow':109

10	Terrebonne Bay	3		\nTHE DEEP EVENING-COLORED ROSE of the sea\r is closing. Sweet crude oil, orange as rust,\r finds an open pathway into the marsh.\r And what you thought would be your home,\r lush with grasses, is no home, drives you out into the gray-glazed\r gates of sleep. Blood flowers\r where we don’t see it. And every chance event\r is a high note racing from stars in sea-depths of brightness,\r and every shock we feel we feel only with the slack\r ropes of our arms. Someone\r wants to hide the body of oil and cannot.\r Someone wants to hide their hands from shame.\r Shark, dolphin, manatee, fish,\r each slick skin an undreamt tine threading its red\r flute-dusk through fumes.\r Sound of the flood-dark pulse.\r Then the second when the water makes no sound.\r  \r  \r THE OLD VANDALS WERE FLOODS AND BOATS\r eroding the banks. The islands that once dotted the bays\r have sunk, disappearing into silverish grit, thinned\r into algae and filament now being made\r quiet by plumes. Despite ourselves\r we are made quiet. The death of the sea\r a thing we must lower ourselves into\r to imagine. I will stay with you here\r inside the sheen of orange that quickly kills,\r not like the saltwater slowly starving the freshwater-\r marshes and grasses that knit this green-wet\r world together. The two breathless gannets\r found covered in oil are not unlike you,\r at the mercy of a mercy that moves in plumes,\r that insists certain fates remain\r invisible. What existed before the oil arrived\r was delicate and mired, a broom of moonlight\r swept through half-choked waves. I trust you\r if you wish for what it, too, might have been.\r  \r  \r LEADING INTO THE BAY are soft green expanses of\r grasses, saltwater channels, slicks\r not glimpsed here before.\r The birds bathe where they can,\r in half-damp shadows that make possible the next free\r climb into air. There is nothing beyond our means to feel it—\r oil pushing up to the surface where the surface-dwellers die,\r turtles pulling in from the Gulf for nesting.\r If I close my eyes I can hear the faint blue\r traces of blood over-gathered by oil\r and the sound of ice near the seafloor.\r  \r There will be a time when nothing living moves,\r a degradation of stillness beyond any liquid scar.\r Still, the solutions of despair are weak\r if you believe you can touch an undersea reef,\r the belly of a small wounded whale.\r You have the power to feel it.\r The breath of the animal\r moving like trust into your arms.\r  \r  \r BEFORE THE HOUR WHEN THE COAST slid into ocean\r we thought we saw a patch of sun greening in waves.\r The slip of a fish. There was a need\r so deep in our bodies we could not even weep.\r We called for an end and that end\r did not come. Power after power, our machine tools\r and cutting tools did nothing to hold back the brown clouds\r rippling in chaotic columns toward the light.\r And what the skies mean, passing over beds of tarred\r seaweed, feels unutterable, like the darkness\r around a candle. Where had we hoped to live?\r You came into the month with dreams.\r You walked on those beaches even though\r you knew they were sick.

18	The Ungovernable	5		\nOne thing I’m not doing in my poems: reporting\r on anything that really happened.\r  \r When I say I’m from New York, Glaswegians say, “Oh, I love Woody\r Allen.” They cannot construe how large a state can be. I just happen to\r actually be from Manhattan.\r  \r How impractical, to imagine that a structure like a government would be\r responsive to the needs of such a lot of people. Held like in a holding pen.\r  \r In the early 1990s I saw a yellow Indian drunk in a tattoo parlor in\r Seattle. He literally said he could literally see right through me. If he said\r it figuratively I took it literally.\r  \r A lot of people in America do not want regulation from the government.\r In principle: our forefathers, our persecution. Ideally we wouldn’t need\r industries and individual actions to be regulated. We wouldn’t even need\r laws.\r  \r People, including people who run corporations or work for them, would\r just behave responsibly. Corporations would take the responsibility of\r personhood seriously.\r  \r My mother cannot be trusted to restrict me from buying R-rated\r videogames at the porn store.\r  \r My mother struggled to love me—the firstborn had been so tractable—she\r still struggles to love me—can she be commanded to love me? Now I see\r what those commandments are about. There must be a God.\r  \r Objectively we could expect that our family members would go out of\r their way to behave toward us with extra care, concern, and with love.\r  \r Sometimes there is a harsh disjunction between what objective perception\r would suggest to us we might expect and what really takes place, or\r “occurs,” within the framework of what we call “our lives.”\r  \r I really saw the other day for the first time that my mother did not\r naturally take to me—I am not much like her. It would take an effort for\r her to understand what matters to me. (Her love will come around.)\r  \r My own daughter is quite different from me—I think—it’s hard to tell, she\r is only five years old. But she looks different—takes after her father, as I\r took after mine—and so far her concerns are not my own. She loves pink.\r I hate pink. (My love moves faster.)\r  \r Where would that moral activity come from, to behave responsibly\r toward others? Not to overcharge, not to seek loopholes, not to dominate,\r not to oppress. Does anyone consciously oppress? I guess some spousal\r abuse comes from the pure urge to dominate, and the ire that results when\r that domination is resisted, or thwarted . . .\r  \r But is it a pure urge or is it coming from an inscribed narrative of gendered\r hierarchy? Like a man wearing a wife-beater has been told too many times\r that his wife is supposed to listen to him and obey him. Now if he can be\r told by the government that “My Strength Is Not for Hurting,” a local\r billboard campaign, maybe that will ring in his ears when he lifts his fist.\r  \r If the government doesn’t do it, who will do it? The church used to do\r it, and still does. The one time I went to church, with my mother, in\r Tennessee, when we were at a family reunion and the whole family had\r certain activities, and one of them was “church on Sunday,” I was brought\r to tears by the simple goodness of the message that the pastor, or reverend\r —minister?—this was a Methodist church—was preaching. It was Father’s\r Day, actually, and he talked about how fathers ought to make sure to\r spend time with their kids. Turn off the TV, he said, and spend some\r time with your kids.\r  \r I was crying because I am not used to an experience of shared instruction\r in goodness. It was very moving to be in a room with real people all\r receiving the same instruction.\n	'1990s':81 'abus':415 'action':140 'activ':386,555 'actual':46,594 'allen':32 'america':118 'anyon':408 'anyth':14 'around':328 'beater':459 'behav':162,243,390 'billboard':496 'brought':566 'buy':181 'call':283 'campaign':497 'cannot':34,174 'care':248 'certain':554 'church':522,536,561,586 'come':327,387,416,444 'command':211,220 'concern':249,367 'conscious':409 'constru':35 'corpor':155,164 'could':98,230 'cri':626 'daughter':331 'day':291,593 'differ':334,353 'disjunct':258 'doesn':513 'domin':403,422,430 'drunk':87 'ear':504 'earli':80 'effort':315 'even':147 'expect':231,269 'experi':634 'extra':247 'famili':234,547,552 'far':365 'faster':381 'father':357,591,600 'figur':108 'first':294 'firstborn':197 'fist':509 'five':347 'forefath':129 'framework':279 'gender':450 'glaswegian':26 'go':237 'god':227 'good':572,639 'govern':59,125,486,512 'guess':412 'happen':17,44 'hard':341 'harsh':257 'hate':376 'held':72 'hierarchi':451 'hold':76 'hurt':493 'ideal':132 'imagin':53 'impract':51 'includ':151 'indian':86 'individu':139 'industri':137 'inscrib':447 'instruct':637,656 'ire':425 'kid':610,623 'larg':37 'law':149 'lift':507 'like':57,73,309,452 'listen':472 'liter':95,99,112 'live':285 'local':495 'look':352 'loophol':400 'lot':69,114 'love':30,194,206,213,252,325,373,379 'm':6,22 'make':603 'man':454 'manhattan':49 'mani':464 'matter':321 'mayb':498 'member':235 'messag':575 'methodist':585 'might':268 'mine':362 'minist':581 'moral':385 'mother':173,191,298,539 'move':380,643 'much':308 'must':224 'narrat':448 'natur':301 'need':65,136,148 'new':24 'obey':476 'object':228,261 'occur':276 'oh':28 'old':349 'one':3,531,557 'oppress':406,410 'other':393 'ought':601 'overcharg':396 'parlor':91 'pastor':578 'pen':77 'peopl':71,116,150,152,651 'percept':262 'persecut':131 'personhood':170 'pink':374,377 'place':274 'poem':11 'porn':188 'preach':588 'principl':127 'pure':419,439 'quit':333 'r':183 'r-rate':182 'rate':184 'real':650 'realli':16,272,287 'receiv':653 'regul':122,143 'report':12 'resist':432 'respons':62,163,168,391 'restrict':178 'result':427 'reunion':548 'reverend':580 'right':101 'ring':501 'room':648 'run':154 'said':96,106,616 'saw':83,288 'say':20,27 'seattl':93 'see':100,217 'seek':399 'serious':171 'share':636 'simpl':571 'sometim':253 'spend':606,618 'spousal':414 'state':39 'still':203,528 'store':189 'strength':489 'structur':56 'struggl':192,204 'suggest':264 'sunday':563 'suppos':470 'sure':604 'take':166,273,302,313,354 'talk':597 'tattoo':90 'tear':568 'tell':343 'tennesse':541 'thing':4 'think':338 'thwart':434 'time':295,465,532,607,620 'told':462,483 'took':110,360 'toward':244,392 'tractabl':201 'trust':176 'turn':611 'tv':614 'understand':319 'ungovern':2 'urg':420,440 'us':245,266 'use':523,631 'videogam':185 'want':121 'way':241 'wear':455 'went':534 'whole':551 'wife':458,468 'wife-beat':457 'within':277 'woodi':31 'work':157 'would':60,160,165,236,263,312,383 'wouldn':134,145 'year':348 'yellow':85 'york':25

22	Woe Are You?	7		\nIt was hardly war, the hardliest of wars. Hardly, hardly. It occurred to me that this\r particular war was hardly war because of kids, more kids, those poor kids. The kids\r were hungry until we GIs fed them. We dusted them with DDT. Hardly done. Reha-\r bilitation of Korea, that is. It needs chemical fertilizer from the States, power to build\r things like a country. In the end it was the hardliest of wars made up of bubble gum,\r which GIs had to show those kids how to chew. In no circumstance whatever can\r man be comfortable without art. They don’t want everlasting charity, and we are not\r giving it to them. We are just lending them a hand until they can stand on their own\r two feet. A novel idea. This is why it occurred to me that this particular war was\r hardly war, the hardliest of wars.\r  \r  \r My father was hardly himself during the war, then I was born during the era that\r hardly existed, and, therefore, I hardly existed without DDT. Beauty is pleasure re-\r garded as the quality of a thing. I prefer a paper closet with real paper dresses in\r it. To be born hardly, hardly after the hardliest of wars, is a matter of debate. Still\r going forward. We are, that is. Napalm again. This is THE BIG PICTURE. War and its\r masses. War and its men. War and its machines. Together we form THE BIG PIC-\r TURE. From Korea to Germany, from Alaska to Puerto Rico. All over the world, the\r US Army is on the alert to defend our country, you the people, against aggression.\r This is THE BIG PICTURE, an official television report to the nation from the army.\r This is Korea! Is one thing better than another? These South Koreans are all right.\r Woe is you, woe is war, hardly war, woe is me, woe are you? My father is still alive,\r and this is how I came to prefer a paper closet with real paper dresses in it.\r  \r  \r Well, it’s morning in Korea. The most violently mountainous place on Earth. Every-\r one has been dusted, existence hardly done, whereas beauty has been regarded as\r the quality of a thing. At Uncle Dann’s Huddle doughnuts and coffee are free and in\r case there are any, for there are many, the unescorted ladies are not permitted. The\r decision has been made in Tokyo for the hardliest of wars, an old soldier made it.\r The situation in Korea is so critical that we the Navy must give the Eighth Army prac-\r tical support. Do you remember how you began this day? How did you spend this\r morning? Woe are you? Well, pinecones fall every day. So why do we fail? Miles and\r miles of homeless refugees set adrift by the Red scourge. \n	'adrift':472 'aggress':277 'alaska':254 'alert':268 'aliv':326 'anoth':301 'armi':264,292,434 'art':102 'beauti':179,366 'began':443 'better':299 'big':228,246,281 'bilit':50 'born':165,203 'bubbl':81 'build':64 'came':332 'case':388 'chariti':108 'chemic':57 'chew':92 'circumst':95 'closet':194,337 'coffe':383 'comfort':100 'countri':68,272 'critic':425 'dann':378 'day':445,459 'ddt':46,178 'debat':215 'decis':403 'defend':270 'done':48,364 'doughnut':381 'dress':198,341 'dust':43,361 'earth':356 'eighth':433 'end':71 'era':168 'everi':357,458 'everlast':107 'exist':171,176,362 'fail':464 'fall':457 'father':155,323 'fed':40 'feet':132 'fertil':58 'form':244 'forward':218 'free':385 'gard':183 'germani':252 'gis':39,84 'give':113,431 'go':217 'gum':82 'hand':123 'hard':6,12,13,23,47,148,157,170,175,204,205,314,363 'hardliest':9,75,151,208,411 'homeless':469 'huddl':380 'hungri':36 'idea':135 'kid':27,29,32,34,89 'korea':52,250,295,349,422 'korean':304 'ladi':398 'lend':120 'like':66 'machin':241 'made':78,406,417 'man':98 'mani':395 'mass':233 'matter':213 'men':237 'mile':465,467 'morn':347,451 'mountain':353 'must':430 'napalm':223 'nation':289 'navi':429 'need':56 'novel':134 'occur':15,140 'offici':284 'old':415 'one':297,358 'paper':193,197,336,340 'particular':20,145 'peopl':275 'permit':401 'pic':247 'pictur':229,282 'pinecon':456 'place':354 'pleasur':181 'poor':31 'power':62 'prac':435 'prefer':191,334 'puerto':256 'qualiti':186,372 're':182 'real':196,339 'red':475 'refuge':470 'regard':369 'reha':49 'rememb':440 'report':286 'rico':257 'right':307 'scourg':476 'set':471 'show':87 'situat':420 'soldier':416 'south':303 'spend':449 'stand':127 'state':61 'still':216,325 'support':437 'televis':285 'therefor':173 'thing':65,189,298,375 'tical':436 'togeth':242 'tokyo':408 'ture':248 'two':131 'uncl':377 'unescort':397 'us':263 'violent':352 'want':106 'war':7,11,21,24,77,146,149,153,161,210,230,234,238,313,315,413 'well':344,455 'whatev':96 'wherea':365 'without':101,177 'woe':1,308,311,316,319,452 'world':261

25	Operation Punctum	7		\nThe television in The Deer Hunter is in Clairton, Pennsylvania. Everything is still at\r Welsh’s Lounge: the clouds, the sky, the unlit neon sign outside the window. All is\r calm, all is bright. I sing in English while my father is in Vietnam. American wives\r are in immeasurable pain and so is my mother. American soldiers are pushing a hel-\r icopter to the right side of the TV screen. Behind the soldiers is number 19. It stands\r for USS Hancock: its nickname, Fighting Hannah. Helicopter whirring. It sounds like\r Godzilla crying. My father is nowhere to be seen because he’s behind the camera,\r behind the lens. His eye’s filled with the green ocean. It zooms in on the soldiers,\r some in uniform, some shirtless, on the decks with number 19 behind them. They’re\r calm and bright, looking down at the flight platform below. Nobody is crying. Num-\r ber 19 goes beyond Yi Sang’s number 13. History is hysterical. The-13th-child-also-\r says-it’s-terrifying. 13+3+3. 19=13. A modest, shared hallucination. I’m still the 13th\r child. And Godzilla is still crying. Hannah ditches the helicopter in the sea. Now\r everything is happening on the left side of the screen. Nobody’s in the cockpit of\r the helicopter. The chopper blades tilt, making a diagonal line across the entire\r screen. That strange cry. It wants to go home—O like me, like my father. Now the\r helicopter and its blades are perfectly vertical to the South China Sea. The chopper\r is now engulfed by the sea, white with foam. Sayonara, Saigon! THIS SEEMS TO\r BE THE LAST CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT IN VIET-\r NAM. Now everything appears in the center of the screen. Helicopter is everything.\r Hannah is everything. My father’s framing never sways even when flowers call to\r him. He edits as he films, he often told me. He’s still nowhere to be seen. Missing\r in action somewhere in Cambodia, filming carpet bombing, my mother said. O the\r chopper’s belly convulses. O it’s in immeasurable pain. The chopper’s door open\r and the pilot and men in white shirts and dark pants spill out. IT’S ALSO BEEN THE\r LARGEST SINGLE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA IT-\r SELF. The chopper’s blades are swirling in every frenzied direction. O suicidal lines.\r Sayonara, Saigon! HILARY BROWN, ABC NEWS ABOARD THE ATTACK AIRCRAFT\r CARRIER USS HANCOCK IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.

The middle classes\r Must have some defence against the vulgar masses.\r They have no use for idle gossips that scarify:\r But in their own leisure get together to verify\r Rumours of rationalists, use of contraceptives,\r Probable bastards, hope of their proving defectives\r (Details being perquisites of good detectives).\r This of course for the parish's sake.

28	Sam Patterson, Harlem, NY: Dec. 12, 1924	8		\nThank you for your time, Mr. Patterson. I understand you were rather close to Mr. Joplin.\r\n \r\nYes, you could say that. Knocked around together for years. But I am curious . . . what is it got you so bent on knowing Joplin's story?\r\n Well sir, his tunes . . . they have given me great comfort in times of need. They saved me in times voracious grief. They help me remember who I am. Where I’m from. Who I was.\r\n \r\nYes. The music will do that—take pain and pour it someplace else for a while.\r\n I believe that his story is higher . . . deeper than the sound of his music. If people knew the sheer will that was put into each note, they might know better how those tunes, that music, let this country talk itself through its own ugliness. I want to uncover the details of his process. I’ve been talking to the people who knew him most intimately, the ones best able to carry his memory forward. So here I am, putting his story together so I can better know . . . ours. I’m hoping you will help me, sir.\r\n \r\nI see. (Laughs)\r\n     You got high expectations, you know that? You don’t always get the story you want. It don’t always show the way to where you think you’re going to. And then too, it don’t change nothing if it’s the past. And ain’t nothing sound more like the past these days than some old ragtime tunes. Some things you just can’t get back.\r\n I’m here for the story as it happened. That’s all I need, Mr. Patterson.\r\n \r\nWell. You seem to know a thing or two about loss. How the world don’t slow itself one step. Whole world seems sold on racing away from whatever it’s ever been. Hooked on leaving its past behind without a trace. Especially after war.\r\n That’s true, sir.\r\n \r\nI see that you’ve seen your share.\r\n I have, sir. With the 369th.\r\n \r\nTook a chunk out of you, huh?\r\n Yes sir. Belleau Wood.\r\n \r\nDamn. You ain’t that one that won the Croix de Guerre, are you?\r\n No, sir. Just one that got a bit . . . rearranged.\r\n \r\nWell, then. Let me pour us a toast . . . Tell me. What story you want to hear? What you need to know?\r\n I want to know about his unpublished work. You helped Mr. Joplin write his final scores?\r\n \r\nWell, I was with him. I was in that room with him for days—weeks. He was pressing up on them keys like he was trying to look into a mirror and find his own face. Blood gone almost all the way bad by then.\r\n Syphilis?\r\n \r\nYeah. That bad blooded dog. It bit him up and spat him out—left nothing but dry bones and a crop of scattered nerves—just enough for him to try and stutter out some last scraps of sound. It was rough, boy. Rough.\r\n Did he get much done?\r\n \r\nWell, in a seeming sort of way. Problem was, he couldn’t hardly start one rag before he would get up and go to the next. Was all broiled up in each one—start one sounding like morning, get halfway through, and end up switching to some chords that left a midnight taste in your mouth. Start another that blew through your bones like a winter frost, then he’d take a break and come back burning up them keys like August in a cotton field.\r\n \nDid he finish any of those compositions?\r\n \r\nCan’t tell you. Might have—but most of what he did finish he ended up callin child’s play. But they weren’t any child’s play, I’ll tell you that. Not any child I ever met. I know ’cause I heard him play it all together one time, just before he lit that match.\r\n \nYou mean that he played the whole thing at once? As one piece?\r\n \r\nThe whole thing. Took all them raggedy pieces and tied ’em all together with a loose string of phrase all syncopated up like a gold pocket watch. A dozen dozen little song parts ticking away, all coiled up spitting and spinning. Times falling away and then coming together at the last minute . . . goodness.\r\n Did it have a name?\r\n \r\nCan’t say it did. Only saw him play it that one night. And everything he was working on was changing titles all the time, anyway. One hour it’d be the If Rag, then turn around and it’d be Lost Boy. Next hour it’d be the Magnetic Rag. Remember Me. Tremble Hand. Hallelujah. Bad Blood. Palms Down. Syncopated Glories. Morning Burl. Seem like they was all getting born up at once—everything he’d had me writing down for all those days and nights. I couldn’t rightly say that all of it was nice sounding. But some of it stuck to me so hard until I could never shake it off. Or maybe it was the way he was playing it—like he was staring down a well. And then sometimes he’d just stop and look at his palms, like he’d brung up a last drink of water. Then he’d just splash it all over that piano.\r\n     But I can still hear parts of it in my head. (Plays)\r\n     That was some good stuff right there. ’Cept he’d played it all stiffed up, bar by bar, most the time.\r\nTill that one last night.\r\n Were you there that night?\r\n \r\nI was there. Well, naw I wasn’t there. I was supposed to be. See, he had just played that thing. Had played it all out, till there wasn’t no more. He was sweating and heaving at the end like he’d been running for everything he’d ever lost. I remember once he looked up like he’d found some secret in the music, and then he did something he’d rarely do—he sang a little with the tune, like I’m in the wind,  baby. I’m in the wind, darling. He was just twirling them keys all around, you know. Just twinkling up those high notes with big bashes of bass. Then too, I remember there was this one part in the music where he sounded like he’d wandered somewhere deep in the notes and couldn’t find a way back. Well, he found his way back alright. But he just wasn’t the same no more.\r\n What happened? How was he different?\r\n \r\nWell, let me see . . . You ever have someone seem all never-beaten all their life, so never-beaten till it’s like they was never weak? So strong till the day you come to know how weak they are—that’s when you see how you never knew their strength? Well, I had been knowing him for days, weeks, years. All the time knowing ’bout his strength—knowing he would be hitting those keys to the end, even when he was out of it, he’d walk out with his head up. He’d seen worse. Lot worse.\r\n     See, sometimes he’d be out on the road, playing his set—everything that had got his name on it, his bread and butter. He’d be up there playin it all grand and professor-like, kinda stilted up and slowed down so that the audience could hear every note shimmering in its own museum. He’d love each rag like it was the children he never got to see grow up—he’d be keepin them all orderly and polite, straining up their voices—not so much as they’d break, but enough to hear them bend up a little into hope, no matter how sad they might be. But never rushin nowhere. Folks was all okay with that back when he first started playin that Maple Leaf and such.\r\n     But it changed. He thought putting those pieces on paper would help hold them the way he heard them—make them stay proper and well behaved.\r\n I imagine he was quite eager to get his work published in order to get compensated.\r\n \r\nYeah, he was glad to see it out in the world. See, he wanted to leave his sound behind him . . . but see, it didn’t work out quite exactly like that. Once those rags were on paper, every ten-fingered bowler-wearing stud would put his hands all over those tunes. Walk them slow at first, till they learned all their ins and outs. They was polite with them tunes, till they figured out how to roll ’em out a little faster, and then make ’em strut and swagger more with each stride. Next thing you know, they was cakewalking them rags up and down that keyboard like a pimp in the tenderloin. Their fingers would work ’em more faster, more prettier than they was supposed to be—all slicked up and leaned back and sideways steppin—hustled up and tricked out like something illegal, ill tempered and ill-begotten gained.\r\n     And started to be like every time he went to a new town, there’d be some light-fingered hustler out to bootstrap himself up, using Scott like a ladder. Come up onstage after Scott all friendly, then play his pieces all to pieces. I mean snapping those rags with a shoeshine boy’s spit and polish, trying to make the best tip of the week by showing the master how to work his own business. He’d say in his polite little professor tone, “Very nice, but too fast, friend!” and they’d just laugh. He would laugh with them a little through his frown, too—because what else could he do?\r\n     And what’s make it worse is that Scott couldn’t keep up with ’em. That ol’ dog syphilis had him by the throat, and had gnawed up almost everything he could do with his hands . . . and every year it got worse, till he would come into town and some folks would think he must’ve been a faker, askin how could the great rag man be all dusted up and unpolished like that? This be Scott Joplin? This?\r\n     But he never stopped, brother. Never stopped. Would always shake it off, even though you know he’d been shook. Always had a plan—an opera, a show . . . \r\n Like Treemonisha, right? Isn’t that what kept him going?\r\n \r\nYeah, trying to get that opera up and runnin kept him going for a long time. Years, maybe. But everybody got limits. And that night, he knew he’d just . . . run out of time. He’d played that patchwork blanket of rags for hours and hours that night, all up and down the fingerboard till the air was about beat out the room. And he was breathless. When he looked up you could see there weren’t that many breaths left for him here on this earth, and when I saw his face . . . boy, I just had to ...\r\n     I had to walk away for a while. I went out that door. Got the night air. Cleaned myself off with wall beneath the streetlights.\r\n So . . . you left the building ...\r\n \r\nYeah. Only left about twenty minutes or so, walking round the block. Came back and there was a glowing off the roof of the building. Ran up all them stairs, thinking the building was on fire, maybe one of them johns had dropped a cigar on the roof. Got there to see him standing next to this big old metal trash can, all blazed up with his songs. He must’ve put some kerosene on them ’cause they was blazed up pretty high and hot—I could feel the heat off those rags—damn, all them beautiful rags—could feel the heat from ten feet away. And I could see Scott on the other side. His face all lit up, his hands trembling and holding one last stash of scribbled up music.\r\n     You can’t stop something you know is gonna happen anyway. And then, you still gotta try. And I did. I tried to fix my mouth to talk at him, talk him down from all that mischief the sickness had put up in his brain. But what could I say? All the things you would say in the same situation. Don’t do it, Scott—your voice on paper, your work, think of your bloodline of sound all burning up, man . . . Who gone show them, man? People need to know . . . \r\n     You know what he said?\r\n What did he say?\r\n \r\nIt was almost like he knew it was coming. This giant hand of wind came right over us from the river. And he threw them rags all up in the air and into the palm of that hand, and it made a fist and smeared his music all over New York. All them notes all scattered over Manhattan like so many raindrops. All them notes burning up in smoke.\r\n     What’d he say? It’s all in the wind, Sam. It’s all in the wind.\n\n	'12':6 '1924':7 '369th':346 'abl':169 'ain':245,360 'air':1824,1882,2157 'almost':456,1679,2129 'alright':1093 'alway':210,219,1738,1750 'anoth':569 'anyway':758,2038

31	D and His Deer	9		\n \r\nD always felt, somehow or other, double. He was an upright line, but then again, he was a curve. When he looked in the mirror straight on, he saw the dapper features of the diplomat he was. But sideways, if he took off his horn-rimmed glasses, he imagined he could be taken for a rather distinguished Dame. He always saw both sides to everything.\r\n     Would he ever find his dæmon—the divine spirit within? Did he really have one spirit? D seemed to be singing a duet with himself.\r\n     Seeing both sides made him a champion procrastinator. D dilly-dallied. Waited till the last minute to decide anything. At every posting, he drove the staff crazy. But that was diplomacy.\r\n     Now dusk dropped on the gated embassy grounds. D flipped on his desk lamp, and the pool of light shut out the trees, looming and dissolving. D drew the drapes, deaf to the delicate drone of insect wings. He returned to his desk, trying to distract himself from a strange little pain that had come to him all his life, like a recurrent dream. (Except, he had to confess, he never dreamed.) The pain was a distinct tiny stab in a spot, well, what would you call that? D called it down there.\r\n     For years, since he was a little d, he considered all the options about this strange pain. It was nothing, really. He went long times between feeling it. Maybe it was too slight to worry about, but then again . . . At last D decided to see a doctor. As a matter of fact, he saw a number.\r\n     “Tell me your dreams,” the first doctor said.\r\n     “Don't bother to ask me, I never dream,” D said.\r\n     “In dreams begin responsibilities,” the doctor quoted.\r\n     D demanded a referral.\r\n     “I've got a very specific pain,” he said to the next doctor. He pointed to, well, down there.\r\n      “Your testicle,” the physician said. Which required a test. Several. And more.\r\n      Finally the second doctor read all the results and announced, “Aha, a dermoid cyst.” What? Inside the cyst were hair follicles and an eye-type thing with eyelashes and a tooth.\r\n     “Do you think I was a twin?” D wondered with a weird kind of delight as he examined the x-ray.\r\n     Well, the doctor wouldn’t go that far. These dermoid cysts were usually removed in childhood. No reason, however, to remove it now. D wouldn’t dream of having it removed! It explained everything! That slightly creepy darling little creature in there must have been a twin, someone D had grown around as she dissolved. D was convinced it was a twin sister.\r\n     And D had absorbed her. Of course he wanted to keep her with him.\r\n     That very day, he had his first dream.\r\n     Exhausted after his discovery, he had returned to the embassy in the late afternoon. Unable to face his office, he diverted his steps from the front walk toward the deserted path on the grounds where no one ever seemed to stroll. He walked deeper into the woods. The path sloped into a shaded dimple in the earth.\r\n     It was dusk in the dell.\r\n     D heard the drone of insect wings. In the mottled light a dragonfly dove straight down. Up curved a damselfly.\r\n     Impulsively D lay down in the leaves in his three-piece suit and curled up like a praying divine, two hands under his chin. He felt himself melting a little. All the old bedevilments dispersed into a delicate dampness. The world softened from darkling to darling . . . \r\n \r\n. . . A stately antlered stag appeared in the distance and slowly, with a calm command, walked closer until D could see that he wore a diamond necklace around his neck. The stag slowly bowed his head, doffed his entire rack of antlers, and raised his head up again, looking directly at D.     Now the deer was a doe! The doe blinked her eyes at D, as if waking. Then she donned the antlers, and turned and walked away . . .\r\n \r\nD woke up ravenously hungry—and overjoyed.\r\n     He dusted himself off and drove straight to dinner. As he stared out the restaurant window, eating his dumplings, he wondered if responsibilities really do begin in dreams.\r\n     Maybe dreams are responsible to us, he thought.\r\n     He felt his sister inside him. She was the reason he was a debonair man, a man who understood that everything has two sides: inner/outer, yes/no. D thought both in lines as sharp as the creases in trousers, and in curves like the swirls of a skirt.     What do I really know? he asked himself. Only that he had woken strangely endeared to himself—and satisfied. Now he understood the necessity of delay. To wait, and then to discover. Never to have only one answer.\r\n     The napkin at the restaurant had come rolled inside a little sparkly ring. “Add this to my bill,” he said to the waiter. And pocketed the little diadem as a reminder of the dyad he was. \r\n \n	'absorb':458 'add':825 'afternoon':490 'aha':348 'alway':6,65 'announc':347 'answer':811 'antler':609,647,678 'anyth':115 'appear':611 'around':443,633 'ask':289,780 'away':683 'bedevil':594 'begin':298,716 'bill':829 'blink':666 'bother':287 'bow':639 'call':214,217 'calm':619 'champion':102 'childhood':407 'chin':584 'closer':622 'come':182,818 'command':620 'confess':196 'consid':230 'convinc':449 'could':56,625 'cours':461 'crazi':123 'creas':762 'creatur':431 'creepi':428 'curl':574 'curv':23,557,767 'cyst':351,355,402 'd':1,5,87,104,136,154,216,228,262,294,303,377,415,440,447,456,540,561,624,657,670,684,753 'dalli':107 'dame':63 'damp':599 'damselfli':559 'dapper':35 'darkl':604 'darl':429,606 'day':471 'deaf':158 'debonair':740 'decid':114,263 'deeper':520 'deer':4,660 'delay':799 'delic':161,598 'delight':384 'dell':539 'demand':304 'dermoid':350,401 'desert':506 'desk':140,170 'diadem':839 'diamond':631 'dilli':106 'dilly-d':105 'dimpl':530 'dinner':699 'diplomaci':127 'diplomat':39 'direct':655 'discov':805 'discoveri':480 'dispers':595 'dissolv':153,446 'distanc':614 'distinct':204 'distinguish':62 'distract':173 'divert':497 'divin':78,579 'doctor':267,283,301,319,341,394 'doe':663,665 'dof':642 'don':676 'doubl':11 'dove':553 'dragonfli':552 'drape':157 'dream':191,199,280,293,297,418,476,718,720 'drew':155 'drone':162,543 'drop':130 'drove':120,696 'duet':93 'dumpl':709 'dusk':129,536 'dust':692 'dyad':845 'dæmon':76 'earth':533 'eat':707 'embassi':134,486 'endear':788 'entir':644 'ever':73,514 'everi':117 'everyth':70,425,747 'examin':387 'except':192 'exhaust':477 'explain':424 'eye':362,668 'eye-typ':361 'eyelash':366 'face':493 'fact':272 'far':399 'featur':36 'feel':247 'felt':7,586,728 'final':338 'find':74 'first':282,475 'flip':137 'follicl':358 'front':502 'gate':133 'glass':52 'go':397 'got':309 'ground':135,510 'grown':442 'hair':357 'hand':581 'head':641,651 'heard':541 'horn':50 'horn-rim':49 'howev':410 'hungri':688 'imagin':54 'impuls':560 'inner/outer':751 'insect':164,545 'insid':353,731,820 'keep':465 'kind':382 'know':778 'lamp':141 'last':111,261 'late':489 'lay':562 'leav':566 'life':187 'light':146,550 'like':188,576,768 'line':16,757 'littl':178,227,430,590,822,838 'long':244 'look':26,654 'loom':151 'made':99 'man':741,743 'matter':270 'mayb':249,719 'melt':588 'minut':112 'mirror':29 'mottl':549 'must':434 'napkin':813 'necess':797 'neck':635 'necklac':632 'never':198,292,806 'next':318 'noth':240 'number':276 'offic':495 'old':593 'one':85,513,810 'option':233 'overjoy':690 'pain':179,201,237,313 'path':507,525 'physician':329 'piec':571 'pocket':836 'point':321 'pool':144 'post':118 'pray':578 'procrastin':103 'quot':302 'rack':645 'rais':649 'rather':61 'raven':687 'ray':391 'read':342 'realli':83,241,714,777 'reason':409,736 'recurr':190 'referr':306 'remind':842 'remov':405,412,422 'requir':332 'respons':299,713,722 'restaur':705,816 'result':345 'return':167,483 'rim':51 'ring':824 'roll':819 'said':284,295,315,330,831 'satisfi':792 'saw':33,66,274 'second':340 'see':96,265,626 'seem':88,515 'sever':335 'shade':529 'sharp':759 'shut':147 'side':68,98,750 'sideway':43 'sinc':223 'sing':91 'sister':454,730 'skirt':773 'slight':253,427 'slope':526 'slowli':616,638 'soften':602 'somehow':8 'someon':439 'spark':823 'specif':312 'spirit':79,86 'spot':209 'stab':206 'staff':122 'stag':610,637 'stare':702 'state':608 'step':499 'straight':30,554,697 'strang':177,236,787 'stroll':517 'suit':572 'swirl':770 'taken':58 'tell':277 'test':334 'testicl':327 'thing':364 'think':372 'thought':726,754 'three':570 'three-piec':569 'till':109 'time':245 'tini':205 'took':46 'tooth':369 'toward':504 'tree':150 'tri':171 'trouser':764 'turn':680 'twin':376,438,453 'two':580,749 'type':363 'unabl':491 'understood':745,795 'upright':15 'us':724 'usual':404 've':308 'wait':108,801 'waiter':834 'wake':673 'walk':503,519,621,682 'want':463 'weird':381 'well':210,323,392 'went':243 'window':706 'wing':165,546 'within':80 'woke':685 'woken':786 'wonder':378,711 'wood':523 'wore':629 'world':601 'worri':255 'would':71,212 'wouldn':395,416 'x':390 'x-ray':389 'year':222 'yes/no':752
32	M's Dream House	9		\nM loved the little house she shared with her mum, its magnolias and mansard roof. Inside, the smell of molasses and ginger had sunk into the timbers. Water mumbled from a hand pump, not a faucet tap. Music murmured, not from a radio, but from a soft piano. All was washed to softness—the sheets, the table linens. Even the gold rims on the old dishes were brushed down to a blur.\r\n     M had been a surprise late baby, and her mother was almost the age of a grandmother. There were only the two of them—plus Maugie, their cat.\r\n     M grew up thinking she understood her mum. But in fact she only understood her in daylight. The night world was where mum paced with her mountains of money worries. Down the hall M blissfully slept, and down in the basement Maugie moused, bringing her prizes up to the landing so M and Mum could find them first thing in the morning.\r\n     And in the morning light Mum’s money misery vanished. She never spoke of it. But when Mum got sick, her worries magnified. Her illness brought the night world to daylight, though she still managed to hide it from her daughter. Mum could no longer hope for a miracle. Unbeknownst to M, just before Mum died, the ancient lady up and took misfortune into her own misguided hands. She sold their home to the neighbors who had always coveted it.\r\n     Why didn’t she tell me? M plagued herself with questions all through the small funeral—she and her mum were the last of their line—and said to her distant cousins and her friends: She never ever mentioned money! Lawyers, real estate agents, and the neighbors of course were summoned. But the deal was done. Though M harbored murder in her heart for those greedy neighbors, she couldn’t get the house back.\r\n     It’s all MY fault—I should have known, M moaned.\r\n     It took a long time for her to settle these affairs. She’d taken a leave from her job at the museum, but eventually she had to go back to work. She and Maugie went to the only place M could afford to buy, a small but gleaming condominium. How could she transfer doilies and dusty velvet couches with broken legs into this glare? What was home any more? She had an iron bedstead, not a sleek futon. Of course Maugie kept finding her way back to the old homestead, and M had to keep quashing the mayhem in her heart as she retrieved the crafty little animal from that basement now full of the neighbor’s traps instead of mice.\r\n     Up in the condo, M’s dreams began. Each night she dreamed of a ruined house. Mornings she woke to a smell like something left in an oven too long, a whiff of burnt molasses. Sometimes in a dream a window without a wall fell to the ground in mockery. Night after night in her sleep M shouldered mountains of blame. But then came morning.\r\n     All she could do was embrace the day. With her long shapely arms, she put on her makeup, donned her mackintosh, and struck out for the museum, determined to muddle through.\r\n     “It’s not my fault, I know,” she said to McM, the man who occupied the next desk. “I just miss my home.” He offered her a meatloaf sandwich. She said, “I never knew my mum, after all.” M’s dreams went on mortgaging her nights. When she startled awake, there was only Maugie at the foot of the iron bedstead squeaking an unsatisfactory plastic rodent, and a monstrous stink of burnt molasses and cat pee.\r\n     M decided to bake. Using her mother’s measuring cups, she chased the aftermaths of the dreams away by spicing the smells. With cinnamon, with allspice, with vanilla and cardamom, she made muffins, mousse, and meringues in the open-concept kitchen. She used all her mother’s bowls, and all her mother’s spoons, to expunge the smells—and she almost did.\r\n     Meanwhile, Maugie knew whenever workmen propped open a staircase door. The cat would slip into the hall, then escape down the stairwell through the service door. And M would get a call at the museum from the mingy mean-spirited neighbors.\r\n     “And what am I going to do with Maugie?” M moaned to McM.\r\n     “Your cat is lonely,” he said. “Does she have service potential?”\r\n     Maugie would be tested. McM agreed to help.\r\n      The minute McM walked into the combo of gleam and old wood and velvet and iron, the marvelous smells wrapped around him. “You’ve been baking,” he murmured approvingly, “in your farmhouse in the sky.” But M was busy wrangling Maugie into the carrier.\r\n     Shortly the cat was deposited on the welcoming laps of ancient ladies in wheelchairs. That champion purr eased the ladies’ hearts. Maugie aced the test. Seeing the ladies, something in M eased, too.\r\n     “My mother is a mystery I may never solve,” she said to McM on one of their lunchtime trips to the old ladies. Maugie now went willingly into her carrier.\r\n     And so the bright weekday activities wore down the mountains of dreams. Blame became a molehill. M’s nightmares became so predictable they were almost friendly. Metamorphosis set in. McM lingered when he held M’s coat, and she lingered as he slipped it on. Their hands met when they put the cat carrier into the car. But these were the gestures of daylight.\r\n     Thinking she was ready to brave the evening light, M had made the mistake of inviting McM for Saturday dinner. When the day came, she lay in bed with a fever, vacuuming was abandoned, her mahogany hair unwashed. Though the mushroom soup gurgled on the stove and the mousse slept in the fridge, the main course had never been started. She left a message canceling.\r\n     McM arrived anyway with merlot and magnolias. He merged into M’s mess. It smelled of cough drops and kitty litter and dust and the fragrance of a woman in a slept-in nightgown. She slid beneath layers of consciousness like the layers of the blankets he straightened for her. And then balancing two hot toddies, fully clothed, he climbed into the bed. Maugie obliged him with a space.\r\n     M was too weak to protest. She woke and drank and woke and slept. At midnight M sat up and slurped the mushroom soup held by McM. Magnificent . . . \r\n     And then she sank. That night of course she dreamed of a house, but this house was merely old, not ruined. It was the homestead, magnolias laden, sheet music still in the piano bench. When she woke, she smelled McM, still fully clothed at her side, his glasses on the floor, batted about by Maugie. Nothing smelled burnt. Unlike her mother, M didn’t believe in miracles. She believed in muddling through. Slowly something had risen in her, like those moons you sometimes see in an afternoon sky, night inside the persistence of day. M sat up in bed, hugging her knees, looking at McM sprawled beside her. The house at last is inside me, she thought. I’ve finally moved. \r\n \n	'abandon':966 'ace':828 'activ':874 'affair':342 'afford':373 'aftermath':638 'afternoon':1182 'age':90 'agent':290 'agre':759 'allspic':650 'almost':88,686,893 'alway':244

33	The Negativo Trio	9		\n      NO was a violin, NOT a viola, and NEVER a cello. They were noble instruments, but highly nonconformist. Prickly in personality, if sexy. Wayward. Always went in their own direction. Made odd choices. Loved the difficult. Naysayed the popular. Collectively unified in a single reaction to the mainstream: negative.\r\n      When they first chanced to come together, they doubted they would ever meld.\r\n      But the minute they began to make music, they discovered a numinous core to their triangle. They couldn’t see this core, smell it, or touch it—and neither could their slender audience (thirty people on folding chairs in a church). But all felt it was a natural union of sound, nimble and sublime.\r\n     That night they became the Negativo Trio.\r\n     Retiring to nestle in the velvet warmth of their cases, they whispered to each other, debriefing and musing in the first of many nightly pajama parties. This very first evening they discovered that what they wanted above all were two things. One was to play their music with the very nacre of its nature, and the other was fame.\r\n     Night after night they played. Increased their bookings. Recorded. And were downloaded. They raised money to pay off the debt of their obscure choices. On stage they each shone with the patina of centuries: maple, spruce, and willow with an elegant varnish of gum arabic, honey, and the whites of eggs.\r\n     But they weren’t famous, even though they played a nocturne as if every note were a black pearl.\r\n     Yet NO, NOT and NEVER did everything everyone advised them to be famous: they networked, they nodded nicely to publicists, they flashed their Negativo news on social media. But the fact was, the trio wasn’t for everybody.\r\n     “Do you think it’s our name?” NOT the Viola asked. “Would we be more famous as the Nightingale Trio?”\r\n     “Nope,” said NEVER the Cello. “Negativo has our brio.” And NEVER was right. The three of them played with nerve. The knottier the piece, the better. They made their audiences reach.\r\n     “We should be sexier,” NO the Violin said. “Naughtier. It’s our propensity for the minor key; we should lighten it up.” But when they played in the minor key, their audiences felt they had arrived at the navel of the universe. The instruments could never give up the minor.\r\n     Would the Negativos ever learn what the people in the seats knew? The trio wasn’t famous because, well, they kind of unnerved people. You had to have nettle to take them on.\r\n     Though they certainly wouldn’t have said no to notoriety, eventually they had to admit that they could not surrender their quirks.\r\n     “We will never be famous,” NEVER said one night after they had nestled in their cases for their midnight debriefing.\r\n     “I’m nauseous,” said NO extravagantly.\r\n     “And neglected,” said NOT excessively.\r\n     “Never,” said NEVER decisively.\r\n     They would never fill the biggest halls. Or be the first name on the tips of tongues. And with the inverted logic of misplaced dreams, even though they had toured, had notched up review, and had triumphs and fans, and websites and bloggers, and a body of criticism devoted to them, they felt they had reached their nadir.\r\n     The next morning they couldn’t seem to get up. They lay immobile, as if their velvet-lined cases were coffins.\r\n      A netherworldly silence descended.\r\n      The dust of despair drifted through the crack between the case tops and bottoms onto these living dead.\r\n     Time dragged like a dirty hem.\r\n     Naught into Nil.\r\n     Desolation into Dormancy.\r\n     Dormancy into . . .\r\n                                 . . . Rest.\r\n     Rest into Snoozing.\r\n     Snoozing into Sleep.\r\n     Sleep into Healing.\r\n     The nostrum of sleep lasted until the pinkish light that heralds spring.\r\n     A noisy nuthatch drilled for insects in a nearby tree. It was a forest sound, yodel-y and ebullient. It awoke the maple and spruce and willow of the Negativo’s constitutions. Their bodies couldn’t help responding to the vernal signal given when spring utters its only word: Nevertheless. \r\n     If not fame, nevertheless music.\r\n     “Numbskull nuthatch!” NEVER growled.\r\n     “Ninny nuthatch,” NO yawned.\r\n     “Bumptious bird,” NOT shifted, inadvertently jostling the snap to the dusty case. It sprang open. NO unclicked and climbed out, too. And NEVER heaved the lid.\r\n      They played immediately of course, trying a violin piece by the underrated Nardini. Most thought him a lightweight, but the Negativos gave it their signature interpretation of naked necessity.\r\n     “Oh it was NOTHING,” they began to say to one another as they did musical favors for themselves, producing scores of synchronicities and the occasional juicy nihilistic dissonance. They buoyed on their notes, as if a midnight Pacific of calm, rich, dark negatives were effused with luminescence.\r\n      How relieved their listeners were to have them back. Again their audiences were made aware of the noses between their ears. That slight, brief piquancy in the nostrils was the smell of earthly harmony. It came from within the airy column that united the instruments, the nucleus of their refusal to suit. Such accord, though it is as rare as ease, seems like nothing.\r\n     And so the Negativo Trio was known as a trio’s trio.\r\n     Not famous, but known.\r\n     Contrary to the vicissitudes of fame, ease is the path of the known, smooth as the satin of the instruments’ finish. To be recognized, yet not to suffer the disadvantages of fame, is a state so ideal it is the pinnacle of a career. NO, NOT and NEVER had at last woken up to that.\r\n \n	'accord':842 'admit':442 'advis':264 'airi':828 'alway':28 'anoth':752 'arab':230 'arriv':380 'ask':304 'audienc':98,343,376,800 'awar':803 'awok':644 'back':797 'becam':123 'began':70,747 'better':339 'biggest':490 'bird':688 'black':254 'blogger':527 'bodi':530,657 'book':193 'bottom':582 'brief':812 'brio':322 'bumptious':687 'buoy':771 'calm':781 'came':824 'career':912 'case':136,465,562,579,698 'cello':14,318 'centuri':219 'certain':430 'chair':103 'chanc':56 'choic':36,209 'church':106 'climb':705 'coffin':564 'collect':43 'column':829 'come':58 'constitut':655 'contrari':869 'core':78,87 'could':95,389,445 'couldn':83,547,658 'cours':717 'crack':576 'critic':532 'dark':783 'dead':586 'debrief':142,469 'debt':205 'decis':484 'descend':568 'desol':596 'despair':572 'devot':533 'difficult':39 'direct':33 'dirti':591 'disadvantag':898 'discov':75,158 'disson':769 'dormanc':598,599 'doubt':61 'download':197 'drag':588 'dream':509 'drift':573 'drill':626 'dust':570 'dusti':697 'ear':809 'earth':821 'eas':849,875 'ebulli':642 'effus':786 'egg':236 'eleg':226 'even':156,242,510 'eventu':438 'ever':64,398 'everi':250 'everybodi':293 'everyon':263 'everyth':262 'excess':480 'extravag':475 'fact':286 'fame':185,676,874,900 'famous':241,268,309,411,454,866 'fan':523 'favor':757 'felt':109,377,537 'fill':488 'finish':889 'first':55,147,155,495 'flash':277 'fold':102 'forest':636 'gave':734 'get':551 'give':391 'given':666 'growl':682 'gum':229 'hall':491 'harmoni':822 'heal':610 'heav':710 'help':660 'hem':592 'herald':621 'high':20 'honey':231 'ideal':905 'immedi':715 'immobil':555 'inadvert':691 'increas':191 'insect':628 'instrument':18,388,833,888 'interpret':738 'invert':505 'jostl':692 'juici':767 'key':361,374 'kind':415 'knew':406 'knottier':335 'known':859,868,881 'last':615,919 'lay':554 'learn':399 'lid':712 'light':619 'lighten':364 'lightweight':730 'like':589,851 'line':561 'listen':792 'live':585 'logic':506 'love':37 'luminesc':788 'm':471 'made':34,341,802 'mainstream':51 'make':72 'mani':149 'mapl':220,646 'media':283 'meld':65 'midnight':468,778 'minor':360,373,394 'minut':68 'misplac':508 'money':200 'morn':545 'muse':144 'music':73,173,678,756 'nacr':177 'nadir':542 'nake':740 'name':300,496 'nardini':725 'natur':113,180 'naught':593 'naughtier':353 'nauseous':472 'navel':383 'naysay':40 'nearbi':631 'necess':741 'negat':52,784 'negativo':2,125,279,319,397,653,733,856 'neglect':477 'neither':94 'nerv':333 'nestl':129,462 'netherworld':566 'nettl':423 'network':270 'never':12,260,316,324,390,452,455,481,483,487,681,709,916 'nevertheless':673,677 'news':280 'next':544 'nice':273 'night':121,150,186,188,458 'nightingal':312 'nihilist':768 'nil':595 'nimbl':117 'ninni':683 'nobl':17 'nocturn':247 'nod':272 'noisi':624 'nonconformist':21 'nope':314 'nose':806 'nostril':816 'nostrum':612 'notch':516 'note':251,774 'noth':745,852 'notorieti':437 'nucleus':835 'numbskul':679 'numin':77 'nuthatch':625,680,684 'obscur':208 'occasion':766 'odd':35 'oh':742 'one':168,457,751 'onto':583 'open':701 'pacif':779 'pajama':151 'parti':152 'path':878 'patina':217 'pay':202 'pearl':255 'peopl':100,402,418 'person':24 'piec':337,721 'pinkish':618 'pinnacl':909 'piquanc':813 'play':171,190,245,331,370,714 'popular':42 'prick':22 'produc':760 'propens':357 'publicist':275 'quirk':449 'rais':199 'rare':847 'reach':344,540 'reaction':48 'recogn':892 'record':194 'refus':838 'reliev':790 'respond':661 'rest':601,602 'retir':127 'review':518 'rich':782 'right':326 'said':315,352,434,456,473,478,482 'satin':885 'say':749 'score':761 'seat':405 'see':85 'seem':549,850 'sexi':26 'sexier':348 'shift':690 'shone':214 'signal':665 'signatur':737 'silenc':567 'singl':47 'sleep':607,608,614 'slender':97 'slight':811 'smell':88,819 'smooth':882 'snap':694 'snooz':604,605 'social':282 'sound':116,637 'sprang':700 'spring':622,668 'spruce':221,648 'stage':211 'state':903 'sublim':119 'suffer':896 'suit':840 'surrend':447 'synchron':763 'take':425 'thing':167 'think':296 'thirti':99 'though':243,428,511,843 'thought':727 'three':328 'time':587 'tip':499 'togeth':59 'tongu':501 'top':580 'touch':91 'tour':514 'tree':632 'tri':718 'triangl':81 'trio':3,126,289,313,408,857,862,864 'triumph':521 'two':166 'unclick':703 'underr':724 'unifi':44 'union':114 'unit':831 'univers':386 'unnerv':417 'utter':669 'varnish':227 'velvet':132,560 'velvet-lin':559 'vernal':664 'vicissitud':872 'viola':10,303 'violin':7,351,720 'want':162 'warmth':133 'wasn':290,409 'wayward':27 'websit':525 'well':413 'went':29 'weren':239 'whisper':138 'white':234 'willow':223,650 'within':826 'woken':920 'word':672 'would':63,305,395,486 'wouldn':431 'y':640 'yawn':686 'yet':256,893 'yodel':639 'yodel-i':638

44	Strikes and Gutters	17		\nAs Walter settled in to finish his coffee, he was struck\r by a phantom, peripheral visage, white as pins in flight, or bunny\r white, in haze — a visit from “The Agent,” in the nominal parlance\r of chemical memory, calling from a distant muddied element.\r Or was it merely the milk he’d spilled in a fatuous\r fit, hooking out to the Brooklyn back of his cup? All he could abide,\r he put his face down in the muck, and made off for The Dude’s abode.\r “These are purple times,” he thought, “when pseudo-pious cliques strike\r polyester poses while jockeying for pockets. And mocking fatuous\r Donny? That sweet prince, that palsied, hiccuping flake of bunny\r fluff?” Not for this aggression would he stand — not for that element.\r It required satisfaction, and of superior sort to parlance.\r Oh, but he would have his ear! Though for this spar: lance\r and blade, tooth and trigger — less to mind, and more, would he abide,\r in body to this immodest plum-clad receptacle. He popped a Velemint,\r and rang His Dudeness’s door. “Bolted,” Duder’s hand had struck\r in ink, “Out of cream. Gone to market. 8pm practice.” His buddy\r was benumbed: “Dash this dairy! You’ve become fat to us\r with cordials of coffee and curds. Oh, uncareful beverage! Such fatuous\r froth and foam will be your undoing!” Yet not undone, but in parlay\r with his special lady, laid up in zesty enterprise, coital as bunnies,\r making maudlin moan. The story is ludicrous. Though if one abides\r that one must “feed one’s monkey,” in manner most gutter-struck,\r and not with precious prandials, “Brie pour lui. Et pour elle,  emmental,”\r one can dig El Duderino’s doings. All others are cowards — elements\r without sentiment, without Johnsons or ethos, foreign and fatuous,\r with lingonberries on leashes, and marmot marmalades struck\r onto pancakes. Neither good men nor thorough, poor in parlance\r and in practice, unable to fix cable or walk on water — though may abide\r it when seated, in slumber, in summer, with clouds above, as Bunny\r puffs on polish. The poor woman, helpless as a frail fawn beneath\r a nude sun. A trophy wife, atrophied, fallen in with the wrong element:\r known pornographers; sycophants; Aimee Mann. Difficult to abide,\r and not exactly lightweights, is she herself to blame for her fatuous\r caprices? Her husband’s lost legs? The Dude’s stained parlor\r rug — his only tether, the life and memory of it, dimmed when stricken?\r Oh, the little for which we are compensated. About the size of our abidance,\r and theirs: some Credence tapes; a can of ashes, released to the  elements;\r specklike Brandt, crisp and shivering.

45	My Love for Nature	18		\nAll this tall grass has ruined my gold\r acrylic nails & I know something’s dead\r just beyond my window. I grew up\r with rats running my floorboards\r & know the smell straining from a body\r once caught in a trap. In the city\r what little I have of an ass\r is always out, a simple wind blow\r from Marilyn Monroe-ing the street.\r Here, in all this nature, there is nobody\r but me & my 5 friends for a week\r & I promised myself I’d be naked\r but the first day I found a tick\r clinging to my arm hair for dear\r life & decided no way I’m exposing\r my pussy to the elements. My love\r for nature is like my love for most things:\r fickle & theoretical.\r Too many bugs & I want a divorce.\r Last week, before I was here\r my uncle drove me from our city\r to the suburbs & sang “Project Chick”\r in the car. When we parked\r he asked me to take off my shoes\r & there we walked, silent, barefoot\r circling the lake, trying to not step\r in goose shit.\r He walked in front & I trailed behind\r both our hands clasped behind our backs.    When you were my daughter,\r     those were the happiest days of my life.\r     I wish you would come home.

46	An Explanation of Doily	19		\nYou asked me last summer: “What is a doily?”\r Sometimes, at lunch, I walk on the beach.\r Today I was coatless. A storm cloud threatened,\r Dark as a spaceship. Should it pour,\r A sister ship down in the water\r Would throw up grappling nets to the surface,\r Rain rise to soak me. Behind a sandbank,\r Waves touched the shore, no more than a shimmer.\r Less rare than its cousin, the antimacassar,\r A doily’s placed between sweet thing and china.\r Both survive where vicars arrive\r For tea, are given thin cup and saucer\r Instead of a mug. If your cake’s so rich\r That it’s leaking syrup, you’ll need a doily.\r Held up, its paper’s the filigree\r Of snowflake, or fingers looked through in fear.\r The shower holds off. My shoe’s a doily.\r Without it, where would I be on these shells\r That crunch underfoot, like contact lenses,\r As I gingerly walk, on my mermaid way\r Back to my husband in his human dwelling?\r Someone is pulling a blue toy trawler\r Along the horizon to port, so smoothly\r It looks realistic. Sea’s partly doily.\r Surfers ride its lace to their downfall,\r After all, we’re nothing but froth.\r Like a carpet salesman, the indolent tide\r Flops a wave over, showing samples: “Madam,\r This one is durable, has a fringe.” Under\r Its breath the sea sighs, “Has it come\r To this? Must everything always end in ... doily?”\r It must. Broad afternoon. The rain-cloud barges\r Have passed and here’s a cumulonimbus parade\r Of imperial busts, the Roman rulers\r In historical order which, I think, would please you.\r Their vapor curls and noble foreheads\r Are lit up in lilac because they’re invading\r The west. Next come the philosophers and, last of all,\r The poets. Pulleys draw them delicately on.\r Here comes Lucretius, then Ovid, then Horace\r In lines, saying relentlessly, “Doily,” “Doily,”\r Till stars take over and do the same.\n	'afternoon':249 'along':180 'alway':242 'antimacassar':75 'arriv':89 'ask':6 'back':165 'barg':254 'beach':21 'behind':57 'blue':177 'breath':231 'broad':248 'bust':265 'cake':104 'carpet':210 'china':84 'cloud':28,253 'coatless':25 'come':237,296,311 'contact':155 'cousin':73 'crunch':152 'cumulonimbus':261 'cup':95 'curl':280 'dark':30 'delic':308 'doili':4,13,77,117,141,193,245,321,322 'downfal':200 'draw':306 'durabl':225 'dwell':172 'end':243 'everyth':241 'explan':2 'fear':132 'filigre':124 'finger':128 'flop':215 'forehead':283 'fring':228 'froth':207 'ginger':159 'given':93 'grappl':47 'held':118 'histor':270 'hold':135 'horac':316 'horizon':182 'human':171 'husband':168 'imperi':264 'indol':213 'instead':98 'invad':292 'lace':197 'last':8,300 'leak':111 'lens':156 'less':69 'like':154,208 'lilac':288 'line':318 'lit':285 'll':114 'look':129,188 'lucretius':312 'lunch':16 'madam':221 'mermaid':163 'mug':101 'must':240,247 'need':115 'net':48 'next':295 'nobl':282 'noth':205 'one':223 'order':271 'ovid':314 'paper':121 'parad':262 'part':192 'pass':256 'philosoph':298 'place':79 'pleas':276 'poet':304 'port':184 'pour':36 'pull':175 'pulley':305 'rain':52,252 'rain-cloud':251 'rare':70 're':204,291 'realist':189 'relentless':320 'rich':107 'ride':195 'rise':53 'roman':267 'ruler':268 'salesman':211 'sampl':220 'sandbank':59 'saucer':97 'say':319 'sea':190,233 'shell':150 'shimmer':68 'ship':39 'shoe':138 'shore':63 'show':219 'shower':134 'sigh':234 'sister':38 'smooth':186 'snowflak':126 'soak':55 'someon':173 'sometim':14 'spaceship':33 'star':324 'storm':27 'summer':9 'surfac':51 'surfer':194 'surviv':86 'sweet':81 'syrup':112 'take':325 'tea':91 'thin':94 'thing':82 'think':274 'threaten':29 'throw':45 'tide':214 'till':323 'today':22 'touch':61 'toy':178 'trawler':179 'underfoot':153 'vapor':279 'vicar':88 'walk':18,160 'water':43 'wave':60,217 'way':164 'west':294 'without':142 'would':44,145,275

49	The Happy	22		\nIn a room more chicken coop than room,\r I rent a fan that feels on my face like sound. Low traffic\r from San Fernando, named for a king who\r became a city, a valley, a saint.\r We are meant to repeat his name. Instead\r I say prickly pear, a cactus\r which spreads its many-paddled hands\r into the space around itself. No pears.\r I call Mom to ask what the latest austerity measures mean.\r Some ants on the wall make their way from one\r unseeable point to another; the banks have closed.\r I tell her to barter; barter what, she says.\r An acquaintance posts “Tourism:\r The Best Way to Be an Ally to Greece”\r as if in each tourist’s pleasure bloomed\r a charity. Mules clabber down the stone paths\r loaded with grapes to make next year’s\r wine, if the tourists come back\r next year, and we hope they will. I say we,\r but I’m closer to they. Living temporarily\r in a neighborhood named for the happy, who were\r who exactly?\r I grow a little stiff with, a little lean with, a little faint with, a little\r worn with seeming.\r I must need to conquer my mind.\r The roses dead because of drought\r because whoever lives here cares enough\r to let their roses die. I must\r need to conquer the notion\r anything needs conquering.\r Something in me can’t tell\r what belongs. The ants\r for whom anything is a street.\r What sounded like a gate opening\r was eucalyptus branches dragging themselves along the tin roof.\r A yellow butterfly that has no interest in me.\r I have no interest in kings.\n	'acquaint':106 'alli':115 'along':257 'anoth':91 'ant':79,239 'anyth':227,242 'around':63 'ask':71 'auster':75 'back':147 'bank':93 'barter':100,101 'becam':32 'belong':237 'best':110 'bloom':125 'branch':254 'butterfli':263 'cactus':52 'call':68 'care':213 'chariti':127 'chicken':7 'citi':34 'clabber':129 'close':95 'closer':161 'come':146 'conquer':200,224,229 'coop':8 'dead':205 'die':219 'drag':255 'drought':208 'enough':214 'eucalyptus':253 'exact':176 'face':19 'faint':189 'fan':14 'feel':16 'fernando':26 'gate':250 'grape':136 'greec':117 'grow':178 'hand':59 'happi':2,172 'hope':152 'instead':46 'interest':267,273 'king':30,275 'latest':74 'lean':185 'let':216 'like':20,248 'littl':180,184,188,192 'live':164,211 'load':134 'low':22 'm':160 'make':83,138 'mani':57 'many-paddl':56 'mean':77 'meant':41 'measur':76 'mind':202 'mom':69 'mule':128 'must':197,221 'name':27,45,169 'need':198,222,228 'neighborhood':168 'next':139,148 'notion':226 'one':87 'open':251 'paddl':58 'path':133 'pear':50,66 'pleasur':124 'point':89 'post':107 'prick':49 'rent':12 'repeat':43 'roof':260 'room':5,10 'rose':204,218 'saint':38 'san':25 'say':48,104,156 'seem':195 'someth':230 'sound':21,247 'space':62 'spread':54 'stiff':181 'stone':132 'street':245 'tell':97,235 'temporarili':165 'tin':259 'tourism':108 'tourist':122,145 'traffic':23 'unseeabl':88 'valley':36 'wall':82 'way':85,111 'whoever':210 'wine':142 'worn':193 'year':140,149 'yellow':262

I have been\r twisting and turning across these lifetimes\r where forgetting me is what you do\r so you don’t have to look at yourself. I saw\r that I would drown in a creek carved out\r of a field our incarnations forged the first path\r through to those mountains. I invited you to stroll\r with me there again for the first time, to pause\r and sprawl in the grass while I read to you\r the poem you hadn’t known you’d been waiting\r to hear. I read until you finally slept\r and all your jagged syntaxes softened into rest.\r You’re always driving so far from me towards\r the me I worry, without you, is eternity.

53	Propositions	26		\nAnyone who begins a sentence with, “In all honesty ... ”\r is about to tell a lie. Anyone who says, “This is how I feel”\r had better love form more than disclosure. Same for anyone\r who thinks he thinks well because he had a thought.\r If  you say, “You’re ugly” to an ugly person — no credit\r for honesty, which must always be a discovery, an act\r that qualifies as an achievement. If  you persist\r you’re just a cruel bastard, a pig without a mirror,\r somebody who hasn’t examined himself enough.\r A hesitation hints at an attempt to be honest, suggests\r a difficulty is present. A good sentence needs\r a clause or two, interruptions, set off  by commas,\r evidence of a slowing down, a rethinking.\r Before I asked my wife to marry me, I told her\r I’d never be fully honest. No one, she said,\r had ever said that to her. I was trying\r to be radically honest, I said, but in fact\r had another motive. A claim without a “but” in it\r is, at best, only half  true.

55	The Flea	28		\nAt a certain point I stopped and asked\r what poems I could write, which were different\r from the poems I wanted to write, with the wanting\r being proof that I couldn’t write those poems, that they\r were impossible.

To see this\r was the beginning of work that could be work,\r not simply pursuit after pursuit that was\r bound to fail, yearning for qualities that were not mine\r and could not be mine. Aiming for a muscular\r logic that could be followed by a reader’s mind\r like an old stone wall running along a landscape, I got\r nothing so solid or continuous. The authority\r I wanted dissolved always into restlessness,\r into a constant gathering of images whose aggregate\r seemed like things that had come to settle\r inside a glove compartment. I had no faith\r in my flaws, but I had a grudging faith\r in the particular. There was the actual stone wall,\r its mongrel irregular blocks harmonized into use, rich\r and ordinary as a soul. There was the flea\r that landed on my forearm one night as I sat reading.\r The black speck of it, then the outsize sting.\r The flea that is an insect, has no wings, can jump\r vertically seven inches and horizontally thirteen inches.\r The flea that looks, through the magnifier,\r like the villain spaceship from a science-fiction movie,\r that can live for years in good conditions, and lives\r by drinking the blood of animals and birds,\r in a practice that is called, by science, hematophagy.\n	'actual':163 'aggreg':131 'aim':86 'along':106 'alway':121 'anim':253 'ask':10 'author':117 'begin':57 'bird':255 'black':195 'block':169 'blood':251 'bound':71 'call':261 'certain':5 'come':137 'compart':143 'condit':245 'constant':126 'continu':115 'could':14,44,61,82,92 'couldn':33 'differ':18,47 'dissolv':120 'drink':249 'fail':73 'faith':147,156 'fiction':236 'flaw':150 'flea':2,182,204,222 'follow':94 'forearm':187 'gather':127 'glove':142 'good':244 'got':110 'grudg':155 'harmon':170 'hematophagi':264 'horizont':218 'imag':129 'imposs':41 'inch':216,220 'insect':208 'insid':140 'irregular':168 'jump':213 'land':184 'landscap':108 'like':100,133,228 'live':240,247 'logic':90 'look':224 'magnifi':227 'mind':99 'mine':80,85 'mongrel':167 'movi':237 'muscular':89 'night':189 'noth':111 'old':102 'one':188 'ordinari':175 'outsiz':201 'particular':159 'poem':12,21,37 'point':6 'practic':258 'proof':30 'pursuit':66,68 'qualiti':76 'read':193 'reader':97 'restless':123 'rich':173 'run':105 'sat':192 'scienc':235,263 'science-fict':234 'see':53 'seem':132 'settl':139 'seven':215 'simpli':65 'solid':113 'soul':178 'spaceship':231 'speck':196 'sting':202 'stone':103,164 'stop':8 'thing':134 'thirteen':219 'use':172 'vertic':214 'villain':230 'wall':104,165 'want':23,28,51,119 'whose':130 'wing':211 'work':59,63 'write':15,25,35 'year':242 'yearn':74

57	From “Salt”	30		\nThey weighed the human soul — twenty-one grams — a tremor\r on the air becoming trance, becoming nimbus. No. It is a deadweight,\r a plummet, drawing down to its harbor beside the heart. It is Breath\r and Word, they said. No. It is pig-iron and salt. The dying\r feel its slow lift as riddance, a bar of darkness hoisting against the light.Something shifted under his skin, it puckered, as might a worm\r going slither-and-tuck close to the nape of his neck, then up\r past the cheekbone and onto the sill of his eye\r to gorge on the image trapped there, the last of her, the last\r lost thing before the sky grew dark and all the windows closed.\r The dead are given permission to walk among us.\r They smile dead smiles, they have no need for speech.\r The familiar goes for nothing. Each evening\r they hold up to our windows their silent, smiling children.\r Salt flats of dream of memory of dream ... limitless horizons\r and out on the utmost rim (can you see?) a house\r white-on-white abstract except for the room-within-a-room\r which can’t be seen but can be known, white being one thing\r in sunlight another under moonlight, not oblivion, not revival,\r and the soul’s song across that windless landscape, unheard;\r by night the heart-stopped silence, by day the rising glare.\r Graves under bramble and a wet light through the trees.\r A quietness something like stealth or sudden absence; it seemed\r to gather and disperse. Rat-run, ground for stray dogs, a place\r where lovers come to be swallowed whole by half-light.\r You could lie down here on thorn, on stone, and find your match.\r Wind-driven salt in the crevice of the rock is how\r memory works: image, invention, regret. It maddens\r with its ersatz colors, unknowable language, sudden reversals,\r shoreline, skyline, cityscape, landscape ... There are those who wake\r with the whole thing fixed at the forefront of their minds:\r a stage-set, people held in a frozen moment who will break\r to action soon, one fearful, one laughing, one clawing at her eyes.\r He was wearing a dead man’s coat: knee-length, snug,\r the lining rich shot silk in midnight blue. “As I thought,”\r she said, “a perfect fit. Of course, you look nothing like him,\r nor do you have that rangy, loose-limbed stride\r or straightness of back.” One side-pocket was sewn up,\r in the other, a letter. He threw it away as he left.\r Music at every turn, music by accident, a voice between\r the phrases, between the notes, calling, calling, and this\r not song but touchstone, blind bargain, last chance.\r Dust-devil, derecho, twister, cyclone, clean sweep,\r she is locked-off in this and the place is dark the way\r a pebble is dark at its center ... then her prophecy-in-song,\r eyes wide open in sleep, his hand across her mouth.\r What they did to him was unwatchable; what they did\r lay far beyond belief — daytime terrors, waking dreamtime,\r the lock-up, breeze-block walls, chain-drag, the Black & Decker\r kicking in: winged creatures, they sing as they work.\r Dust and shadow, come back to that, come back with a heavy heart.\r Is there nothing more: is that what you heard yourself say?\r Children in the garden, the headlong rush, the wolf pack\r between trees and snowfall under moonlight: the story you told\r is the story you were told: snow and a frost-moon, as clear, as pitiless.\r He untangled the thing that had snagged in her hair, his hand\r through a spectrum, spectral, blurring, a rail of fingers,\r to lift the thing in her hair. It would rain that day: cloud low\r to the hills, morning as nightfall, her window open to that.\r Slow sacrament of cheese and olive oil and bread, the creep\r of sundown-sunlight on the wall. “How safe do you feel\r at times like this?” Laughing, he bared his teeth. A thing flew in\r at the open window, bird or bat. “It’s like looking at clear water\r through clouded glass.” They were far off from anywhere.\r A salted seam, just fool’s gold, leavings of a dream wherein\r you give a true report of who you were, of what you could become.\r In rainfall you’re invisible, in sunlight the same, that’s all\r the dream gives up: a sense of place and sudden banishment.\n	'absenc':257 'abstract':187 'accid':443 'across':223,506 'action':358 'air':16 'among':133 'anoth':211 'anywher':714 'away':433 'back':417,554,558 'banish':763 'bar':60 'bare':685 'bargain':461 'bat':698 'becom':17,19,740 'belief':522 'besid':33 'beyond':521 'bird':696 'black':539 'blind':460 'block':533 'blue':388 'blur':626 'brambl':242 'bread':664 'break':356 'breath':38 'breez':532 'breeze-block':531 'call':452,453 'center':492 'chain':536 'chain-drag':535 'chanc':463 'cheekbon':93 'chees':659 'children':161,574 'cityscap':326 'claw':365 'clean':470 'clear':607,704 'close':82,125 'cloud':643,707 'coat':376 'color':319 'come':275,553,557 'could':285,739 'cours':398 'creatur':544 'creep':666 'crevic':303 'cyclon':469 'dark':62,120,483,489 'day':236,642 'daytim':523 'dead':127,137,373 'deadweight':25 'decker':540 'derecho':467 'devil':466 'die':52 'dispers':263 'dog':270 'drag':537 'draw':28 'dream':165,169,725,754 'dreamtim':526 'driven':299 'dust':465,550 'dust-devil':464 'ersatz':318 'even':151 'everi':439 'except':188 'eye':100,368,499 'familiar':146 'far':520,711 'fear':361 'feel':53,678 'find':294 'finger':630 'fit':396 'fix':337 'flat':163 'flew':690 'fool':719 'forefront':340 'frost':604 'frost-moon':603 'frozen':352 'garden':577 'gather':261 'give':728,755 'given':129 'glare':239 'glass':708 'go':77 'goe':147 'gold':721 'gorg':102 'gram':11 'grave':240 'grew':119 'ground':267 'hair':619,637 'half':282 'half-light':281 'hand':505,621 'harbor':32 'headlong':579 'heard':571 'heart':35,232,562 'heart-stop':231 'heavi':561 'held':349 'hill':647 'hoist':63 'hold':153 'horizon':171 'hous':182 'human':6 'imag':105,311 'invent':312 'invis':745 'iron':48 'kick':541 'knee':378 'knee-length':377 'known':204 'landscap':226,327 'languag':321 'last':109,113,462 'laugh':363,683 'lay':519 'leav':722 'left':436 'length':379 'letter':429 'lie':286 'lift':56,632 'light':246,283 'light.something':66 'like':253,402,681,701 'limb':412 'limitless':170 'line':382 'lock':475,529 'lock-up':528 'locked-off':474 'look':400,702 'loos':411 'loose-limb':410 'lost':114 'lover':274 'low':644 'madden':315 'man':374 'match':296 'memori':167,309 'midnight':387 'might':74 'mind':343 'moment':353 'moon':605 'moonlight':213,589 'morn':648 'mouth':508 'music':437,441 'nape':85 'neck':88 'need':142 'night':229 'nightfal':650 'nimbus':20 'note':451 'noth':149,401,565 'oblivion':215 'oil':662 'oliv':661 'one':10,207,360,362,364,418 'onto':95 'open':501,653,694 'pack':583 'past':91 'pebbl':487 'peopl':348 'perfect':395 'permiss':130 'phrase':448 'pig':47 'pig-iron':46 'pitiless':609 'place':272,481,760 'plummet':27 'pocket':421 'propheci':496 'prophecy-in-song':495 'pucker':72 'quiet':251 'rail':628 'rain':640 'rainfal':742 'rangi':409 'rat':265 'rat-run':264 're':744 'regret':313 'report':731 'revers':323 'reviv':217 'rich':383 'riddanc':58 'rim':177 'rise':238 'rock':306 'room':192,195 'room-within-a-room':191 'run':266 'rush':580 'sacrament':657 'safe':675 'said':42,393 'salt':2,50,162,300,716 'say':573 'seam':717 'see':180 'seem':259 'seen':200 'sens':758 'set':347 'sewn':423 'shadow':552 'shift':67 'shorelin':324 'shot':384 'side':420 'side-pocket':419 'silenc':234 'silent':159 'silk':385 'sill':97 'sing':546 'skin':70 'sky':118 'skylin':325 'sleep':503 'slither':79 'slither-and-tuck':78 'slow':55,656 'smile':136,138,160 'snag':616 'snow':600 'snowfal':587 'snug':380 'someth':252 'song':222,457,498 'soon':359 'soul':7,220 'spectral':625 'spectrum':624 'speech':144 'stage':346 'stage-set':345 'stealth':254 'stone':292 'stop':233 'stori':591,596 'straight':415 'stray':269 'stride':413 'sudden':256,322,762 'sundown':669 'sundown-sunlight':668 'sunlight':210,670,747 'swallow':278 'sweep':471 'teeth':687 'terror':524 'thing':115,208,336,613,634,689 'thorn':290 'thought':391 'threw':431 'time':680 'told':593,599 'touchston':459 'tranc':18 'trap':106 'tree':249,585 'tremor':13 'true':730 'tuck':81 'turn':440 'twenti':9 'twenty-on':8 'twister':468 'unheard':227 'unknow':320 'untangl':611 'unwatch':515 'us':134 'utmost':176 'voic':445 'wake':332,525 'walk':132 'wall':534,673 'water':705 'way':485 'wear':371 'weigh':4 'wet':245 'wherein':726 'white':184,186,205 'white-on-whit':183 'whole':279,335 'wide':500 'wind':298 'wind-driven':297 'windless':225 'window':124,157,652,695 'wing':543 'within':193 'wolf':582 'word':40 'work':310,549 'worm':76 'would':639

For me, drinking that\r first cup of Orange Pekoe\r and making tea\r my drink      risking rattlesnake poison\r with every steaming cup,\r a tiny emblem of a rebellion I still try to practice.\r You left us so quickly, Marilyn,\r and without any warning this January,\r your house full of cancelled aspirations — glass\r bowls, and cylinders, and huge globes\r filled with sea scallop shells\r             you combed the California seashores to \r                         find, collecting these empty shells, washed\r free of their biological life.                                 Out of the ocean:\r we two different daughters of a sailor.\r  \r april 3 \r The spinning                      the scissors               the measuring\r and thus our lives are given out\r from the heavens, with unfair allotments\r and varied, unaccountable fates,\r born when we are, and to whom\r you would have prevailed\r in an age where women had to spin,\r weave the material, cut it into britches and dresses,\r undergarments and sheets, sew\r and keep clean, warm, and comfortable a\r household full or a castle full / men\r children, hired hands, maidservants — you would have\r done it\r so well.\r But you would have died young in such a world — \r diabetes, asthma, chronic bronchial infections\r even in the 21st century where you lived to be\r 76       a world where all your skills were plied as\r             substitute\r for being an artist.\r                       When I asked you a year ago,\r not knowing that you would die this January,\r what you would most like to have, if\r money were not the object\r              — since clearly all your measuring, cutting, and sewing\r             had been for economical reasons,\r             not art — \r you thought for a bit, raising your chin.\r “A swimming pool in my backyard. One I could\r step into every morning, swim, float — maybe in the afternoon\r I’d go for a dip. Many evenings, I think,” she said\r to me.                     Longing for some ocean? \r In our portrait,\r if someone paints it, she will be \r sitting in a scallop shell,\r her many jars of seashells behind her head. I\r will be invisible, except for the spinning \r murmuration of birds that radiates\r             past me. \r They read at her funeral, a poem from her journal\r about lying on the beach,\r the sand embracing her.\r How much she loved it / felt safe,\r felt released. Oh, Marilyn, all\r those seashells emptied of their living\r fleshy occupants. (the ugly parts that die and rot) now\r glorious empty rooms\r             in which to live an imaginary life,\r                         to decorate,\r to create beauty, \r             spaces to live\r                         a different life.\r What is left but your desires, locked in glass, and\r an image of you walking\r your beloved beaches, hands \r full of seashells, your\r footprints measured, then quickly filled \r with the tidal flow.\r  \r april 4 \r my spinning, \r             a whirlpool of faceted moving lights\r                         Everything is Numbers!\r down into a vortical glare that replaces\r             my own mind’s desire \r                         Everything is Numbers! Everything is Numbers!\r floating down\r             like the crow’s\r                         onyx feather\r the 8\r             of spades\r                         random card\r appearing\r             last week\r                         over gravel\r 8 legs on a spider,\r             the arachnid so many people seem to\r             fear, yet I lose track of time, stare into the wall\r             or any space to replace real images with my imaginary\r             ones, some random spider, who spins my fate\r Crazy Eights, the child card game Marilyn and I played\r pieces of eight, the dollar of\r             pirate Spain — our childhood in Orange County\r 8, a vertical infinity sign\r             everything is numbers / your\r                         fire opal that Daddy brought\r to you from India, and our mother\r paid a jeweler to set it\r into a ring. You wore the ring\r more than sixty years. I suppose it was\r on your finger at death\r spinning,     spinning\r to scintillate and iridesce\r             We never had nice shoes.\r  \r april 5 \r Easter Sunday. You and I always dyed\r Easter eggs together, our mother busy at\r her forty-hour-a-week bookkeeper’s job. I \r was intrigued with the colors,\r but they never turned out so bright when\r coloring the eggs. You, the artist,\r were interested in the designs\r to transfer onto the eggs,\r cartoons, bunnies,\r chicks.\r We kept our eggs\r separated from each other,\r put them in separate bowls, neither\r caring for the other’s creation. Still we\r felt connected, even joyful, on those few holiday projects.\r Not enough to make us friends.\r My unwillingness to be like our classmates\r embarrassed you. You chose invisibility\r in school, rather than being known as “Diane’s\r Sister.” \r That unwillingness to be like others \r was what made me a poet. So many little things, but that early decision\r of yours, not to understand why I wanted to be weird,\r is what made you make so \r many other small choices, preventing you \r from becoming an artist. “Look away,” our mother said to us,\r when there were ugly things confronting us. \r I could not do that. You blame\r our mother, yet it was you who decided to look away,\r even though it meant not seeing the whole world,\r even if meant you didn’t become an artist.\r Poverty, of course, was the reason\r we never had nice shoes.\r  \r april 6 \r All numbers have\r disappeared\r                         instead\r             there are mushrooms\r             fungi that has always seemed\r             more artful than tasty\r             Sipping a cup of tea / soothes me\r             as the mushrooms in a veloute sauce\r             never could.\r             I feel stymied / a rider\r             with no horse. I want only to watch\r             the stories unfold / the secret stories about why\r             you chose to marry and have children / why\r             I did not / the stories\r                                     I try to banish\r             blot out, replace with the diamond\r             dog. A murmuration of iridescent starlings, \r             and the spider of eight, \r             twirling on its silk line, projecting infinity      art\r             is made when you subject yourself\r             to the unacceptable, then dredge\r             yourself out,\r                                     find a mineral replacement:\r             infinity\r             iridescer\r             irised feather\r             scintillater\r                         a crystalline body whirls\r             releasing me from\r             the history, the stories it’s\r             so hard to tell.\r Until recent years, my sister\r and I either ignored or disliked each other.\r We fought continuously as children.\r I have in my wrist a black bump that\r protrudes near a vein.\r                                     It’s the point of a pencil\r that broke off and penetrated my wrist as we struggled\r for the long yellow weapon.\r A pencil, the weapon of a writer. But there was \r no bleeding, no seeming-wound to be dressed. \r We never told\r our Mother, both too ashamed\r of our brutality. I’ve never asked a doctor\r about it, the pencil lead encapsulated\r in my wrist. Nor ever spoken\r of it to anyone.\r I always wonder that so much must remain a secret?\r Why\r             we never had nice shoes.\r  \r april 7 \r Young Marilyn, Old Marilyn.\r there are places on this planet where\r I find it hard to detect any beauty\r therefore, silence\r                         No nice shoes.\r  \r april 8 \r there is silence\r  \r april 9 \r Drinking\r a blend of traditional\r Darjeeling with a touch of Ceylon / this\r tea takes me back to a Viennese visit, drinking\r this very tea in the afternoon while my friend, Jonathan,\r ate their famous Sacher torte.\r The tea\r seemed particularly aromatic — \r             “lightly scented with oil of bergamot\r             and a hint of genuine Bourbon vanilla.”\r Wishing for the moment in the past to reappear. I didn’t know\r the tea from the Sacher Hotel\r was as famous as the cake\r                                 until I found in my Upton Tea catalogue\r                                 a listing for “Scented Darjeeling”\r                                 under the heading “Earl Grey Blends”\r This tea,\r any cup of tea!\r Hard to believe. no! Sad to\r think my Mother almost spat out her first taste\r of tea.\r What worldly thing must I touch to\r bring Marilyn back into my\r sedate life, my sister Marilyn who died in January? \r Her hand — I’d like to imagine timidly touching her\r       hand — Marilyn’s hand.\r             Her right hand on which she wore the fire opal ring.\r                         In that hand she’d be holding a cigarette.\r Smoke and fire makes me think of her — \r             not water, though it was that Pacific ocean \r                         filled with seashells\r                                     that she was in touch with. My old hands,\r not really like hers at all. She had big hands for shaping things,\r             while mine are small,      like birds.\n	'1':9 '17':262 '2':115 '21st':693 '3':594 '4':942 '5':1114 '6':1339 '7':1597 '76':700

62	Green Bananas	35		\nThe way my grandmother put back the green bananas,\r unwilling to make an investment in her future,\r is how I’m feeling, watching my grown children watching\r CNN, sitting side by side on the sofa—no teasing, no tattling—\r just image upon image of Armageddon: starvation, explosions,          \r long lines at the gas pump, and even the Rabbi abandoning town.\r           Biological, my son says. And my daughter answers no, nuclear.\r I’m too embarrassed just now to admit how happy I am\r to have them home again, even though they’re only visitors,\r no longer “at home.” I built my house too close to the water,\r  \r my grandmother used to say whenever I went away. She meant\r she was easily moved to tears, and it took my own mother years\r to teach me the impossibility of protecting the weak\r from the strong. Enough crying, she’d say, clicking her tongue\r  \r like she was contesting the intricate but historical patterns\r of sudden death. You don’t die so easily. You have to suffer first.\r She meant, I now know, to comfort me, to protect me\r from her brother’s tank blown upside down in Germany,\r  \r the long lines at the gas pumps, the clergy blissfully following\r their prayers back home. O but then she’d kiss whatever ailed me,\r while my sister railed against injustice, her theme song exploding\r above the cushion separating her rights from all I’m still doing wrong.\r  How can we expect world peace, my father would have said,\r —if he wasn’t at that very moment watching I Love Lucy’s slide\r across the world’s stage on an overripe banana—when under one roof my own two children can’t get along.\r  \r As for me, just now I’m setting the table and filling the fruit bowl,\r whistling like Ricky Ricardo, unaware of his wife’s grand schemes,\r the well intentioned but certain and coming disaster. Please stay,Grandma, I say, holding her tightly in the aisle, unashamed of my tears.\r But of course, she died that very day, falling into honeydews,\r the melons, like hand grenades, rolling every which way.\r  \n	'abandon':60 'across':268 'admit':79 'ail':218 'aisl':333 'along':288 'answer':69 'armageddon':47 'away':116 'back':8,209 'banana':2,11,276 'biolog':62 'bliss':205 'blown':191 'bowl':303 'brother':188 'built':100 'certain':319 'children':28,284 'clergi':204 'click':149 'close':104 'cnn':30 'come':321 'comfort':181 'contest':155 'cours':340 'cri':145 'cushion':232 'd':147,215 'daughter':68 'day':345 'death':163 'die':167,342 'disast':322 'easili':121,169 'embarrass':75 'enough':144 'even':57,89 'everi':355 'expect':246 'explod':229 'explos':49 'fall':346 'father':250 'feel':24 'fill':300 'first':174 'follow':206 'fruit':302 'futur':19 'gas':54,201 'germani':195 'get':287 'grand':313 'grandma':325 'grandmoth':6,109 'green':1,10 'grenad':353 'grown':27 'hand':352 'happi':81 'histor':159 'hold':328 'home':87,98,210 'honeydew':348 'hous':102 'imag':43,45 'imposs':136 'injustic':225 'intent':317 'intric':157 'invest':16 'kiss':216 'know':179 'like':152,305,351 'line':51,198 'long':50,197 'longer':96 'love':264 'luci':265 'm':23,73,239,295 'make':14 'meant':118,176 'melon':350 'moment':261 'mother':130 'move':122 'nuclear':71 'o':211 'one':279 'overrip':275 'pattern':160 'peac':248 'pleas':323 'prayer':208 'protect':138,184 'pump':55,202 'put':7 'rabbi':59 'rail':223 're':92 'ricardo':307 'ricki':306 'right':235 'roll':354 'roof':280 'said':253 'say':65,112,148,327 'scheme':314 'separ':233 'set':296 'side':32,34 'sister':222 'sit':31 'slide':267 'sofa':37 'son':64 'song':228 'stage':272 'starvat':48 'stay':324 'still':240 'strong':143 'sudden':162 'suffer':173 'tabl':298 'tank':190 'tattl':41 'teach':133 'tear':124,337 'teas':39 'theme':227 'though':90 'tight':330 'tongu':151 'took':127 'town':61 'two':283 'unasham':334 'unawar':308 'unwil':12 'upon':44 'upsid':192 'use':110 'visitor':94 'wasn':256 'watch':25,29,262 'water':107 'way':4,357 'weak':140 'well':316 'went':115 'whatev':217 'whenev':113 'whistl':304 'wife':311 'world':247,270 'would':251 'wrong':242 'year':131
63	Counting to Six Million	35		\nI.Sleep faster, my son says. He’s poking\r at my eyelids, pulling at the pillows, the helicopter\r hum of anticipation rising in his throat as I reach out\r and spin him onto the bed. I want to set my heels\r once more in the soft underbelly of his childhood,\r  \r airlift him from danger, from disease, from all his fears,\r which are maybe not even his fears at all, but only mine.\r Yet now as he hovers above me, my body splayed out\r like my father’s before me, my every breath is less a prayer\r than a love letter torn open in desperation.\r  \r II.\r Remember, I say, when we counted to six million,\r a visualization of tragedy, one half hour a day \r for two years, and that, for the tribe only; it would take\r another whole year for the gypsies, the Catholics, the gays,\r the foreigners, the Negroes, the artists, the philosophers, etc.\r  \r You were barely six at the time, your mother wondering\r what the hell I was thinking, and even now I can’t fathom\r why I didn’t just hold you close—\r It would have taken only a moment—\r And say whatever it was that I really wanted to say.\r  \r III.\r I’m watching Batman reruns when the telephone rings.Holy Charoset, I yell at the kitchen wall, call back later.\r Maybe I threw some raisins, I don’t remember.\r We’re already married, your mother and I,            \r but at the time, don’t ask, I was living alone. \r  \r And so I’m laughing, mostly from boredom, but still, laughing,\r while my father lay dying, gasping for breath in some dirty gutter,\r gunned down for a half-empty briefcase, a gefilte fish sandwich,\r and a New York Post which the next day would have\r his picture on the twenty-eighth page; one more dead Jew.\r  \r  \r IV.\r You burst into the room, fifth grade facts burning your tongue\r like Moses’ coal. 100 people die every minute, you tell me\r as I turn down the TV; and then, gleefully: 50 since I’ve been  in this room, and now 75 and now . . . O my little census bureau,\r my prince of darkness, my prophet of numbers, riddle me this:\r  \r how many grains of sand before you can call it a desert?\r And where were you the day Kennedy was shot? CNN, interrupting,\r asks. My grandmother clicks her tongue like she’s chopping onions\r in the old country. Poor boy, she says, pointing.\r And there’s John-John again, waving that little flag, still saluting.\r  \r  \r V.\r And who will remember my father when I am gone? And\r how many have died since his death? And what’s one more.\r or one less. And what do I know of my father’s father?\r I’m waiting outside, engine humming, as my son,\r eighteen, registers. And now he’s shouting,\r  \r running towards me, arms pumping above his head.\r He’s Moses the moment before spying the golden calf.\r He’s his great grandfather crawling underground to freedom.\r He’s my father flying medical supplies, surviving the crash.\r My mother must have held him close. You’re home, she cries, safe.\r  \r VI.\r Vietnam, I say, or Sarajevo.  Afghanistan, my son answers, or Iraq.\r My father would have said Germany. He could have said Japan.\r Nobody says anonymously. Nobody says Gotham.\r Korea, my cousin says, or Kosovo.  My great grandfather \r says South Africa. His great grandfather says Spain.\r  \r Somebody says Egypt now; somebody, Egypt then.\r Nobody says suddenly. Nobody says Brooklyn. I’m counting\r myself to sleep, when my wife hears a sound at the door. Careful,\r she whispers. We’re alone, in an empty house; my every breath\r reminding me I’m older than my father, on the day of his death.\r                  \r  \r VII.There are more people breathing this very moment, my son insists, than have ever died. He’s home from college, so I don’t double-check.\r He’s driven a long way to surprise me on my birthday. Are you sure\r you can’t stay, I ask, holding him close. He looks full of hope;\r a woman I’ve never seen before at his side. Welcome home,\r  \r I tell my wife. She’s just turned twenty-four. I’m childless,\r fatherless. It’s the day of the funeral; Nineteen years until\r the twin towers. Three thousand since Moses murdered\r the overseer. But that’s not what I’m thinking. One, two, three,\r she says, guiding me inside. How could we not fall back in love?\r  \n	'100':328 '50':345 '75':355 'afghanistan':539 'africa':573 'airlift':54 'alon':254,612 'alreadi':238 'anonym':558 'anoth':139 'answer':542 'anticip':24 'arm':486 'artist':154 'ask':250,397,681 'back':225,758 'bare':160 'batman':211 'bed':38 'birthday':672 'bodi':84 'boredom':262 'boy':413 'breath':95,273,619,638 'briefcas':285 'brooklyn':591 'bureau':362 'burn':322 'burst':315 'calf':500 'call':224,382 'care':607 'cathol':146 'census':361 'charoset':217 'check':660 'childhood':53 'childless':715 'chop':406 'click':400 'close':188,526,684 'cnn':395 'coal':327 'colleg':653 'could':552,754 'count':1,114,594 'countri':411 'cousin':564 'crash':519 'crawl':506 'cri':531 'danger':57 'dark':366 'day':126,298,391,630,720 'dead':311 'death':448,633 'desert':385 'desper':107 'didn':183 'die':270,330,445,648 'dirti':276 'diseas':59 'door':606 'doubl':659 'double-check':658 'driven':663 'egypt':581,584 'eighteen':476 'eighth':307 'empti':284,615 'engin':471 'etc':157 'even':68,175 'ever':647 'everi':94,331,618 'eyelid':15 'fact':321 'fall':757 'faster':6 'father':89,268,436,464,466,513,546,627 'fatherless':716 'fathom':180 'fear':63,70 'fifth':319 'fish':288 'flag':427 'fli':514 'foreign':150 'four':712 'freedom':509 'full':687 'funer':723 'gasp':271 'gay':148 'gefilt':287 'germani':550 'gleefulli':344 'golden':499 'gone':440 'gotham':561 'grade':320 'grain':376 'grandfath':505,570,576 'grandmoth':399 'great':504,569,575 'guid':750 'gun':278 'gutter':277 'gypsi':144 'half':123,283 'half-empti':282 'head':490 'hear':601 'heel':44 'held':524 'helicopt':21 'hell':170 'hold':186,682 'home':529,651,701 'hope':689 'hour':124 'hous':616 'hover':80 'hum':22,472 'i.sleep':5 'ii':108 'iii':207 'insid':752 'insist':644 'interrupt':396 'iraq':544 'iv':313 'japan':555 'jew':312 'john':421,422 'john-john':420 'kennedi':392 'kitchen':222 'know':461 'korea':562 'kosovo':567 'later':226 'laugh':259,265 'lay':269 'less':97,456 'letter':103 'like':87,325,403 'littl':360,426 'live':253 'long':665 'look':686 'love':102,760 'm':209,258,468,593,623,714,743 'mani':375,443 'marri':239 'mayb':66,227 'medic':515 'million':4,117 'mine':75 'minut':332 'moment':195,495,641 'mose':326,493,733 'most':260 'mother':166,241,521 'murder':734 'must':522 'negro':152 'never':694 'new':292 'next':297 'nineteen':724 'nobodi':556,559,586,589 'number':370 'o':358 'old':410 'older':624 'one':122,309,452,455,745 'onion':407 'onto':36 'open':105 'outsid':470 'overs':736 'page':308 'peopl':329,637 'philosoph':156 'pictur':302 'pillow':19 'point':416 'poke':12 'poor':412 'post':294 'prayer':99 'princ':364 'prophet':368 'pull':16 'pump':487 'raisin':231 're':237,528,611 'reach':31 'realli':203 'regist':477 'rememb':109,235,434 'remind':620 'rerun':212 'riddl':371 'rings.holy':216 'rise':25 'room':318,352 'run':483 'safe':532 'said':549,554 'salut':429 'sand':378 'sandwich':289 'sarajevo':538 'say':9,111,197,206,415,536,557,560,565,571,577,580,587,590,749 'seen':695 'set':42 'shot':394 'shout':482 'side':699 'sinc':346,446,732 'six':3,116,161 'sleep':597 'soft':49 'somebodi':579,583 'son':8,475,541,643 'sound':603 'south':572 'spain':578 'spi':497 'spin':34 'splay':85 'stay':679 'still':264,428 'sudden':588 'suppli':516 'sure':675 'surpris':668 'surviv':517 'take':138 'taken':192 'telephon':215 'tell':334,703 'think':173,744 'thousand':731 'three':730,747 'threw':229 'throat':28 'time':164,247 'tongu':324,402 'torn':104 'toward':484 'tower':729 'tragedi':121 'tribe':134 'turn':338,709 'tv':341 'twenti':306,711 'twenty-eighth':305 'twenty-four':710 'twin':728 'two':128,746 'underbelli':50 'underground':507 'v':430 've':348,693 'vi':533 'vietnam':534 'vii.there':634 'visual':119 'wait':469 'wall':223 'want':40,204 'watch':210 'wave':424 'way':666 'welcom':700 'whatev':198 'whisper':609 'whole':140 'wife':600,705 'woman':691 'wonder':167 'would':137,190,299,547 'year':129,141,725 'yell':219 'yet':76 'york':293
64	The Jews that We Are	35		\nI.   March 1979 and I am watching Nazis\r march through Chicago. The bold type\r of the Sun-Times describes a small band\r of hoodlums, undereducated boy scouts, the better\r to be ignored. My grandfather, back hunched\r over his Bible, agrees. Jews like myself\r should stay home, should lay down our stones\r and pray like the Jews that we are.\r  \r II.   Grandfather, you are easy to love\r with your long beard and the way you sway\r like a palm branch in the storm. It is easy\r to romanticize your spiritual search,\r worldly naiveté and wise rabbinical words.\r You belong in the books I read\r by Singer, Peretz, Sholom Aleichem.\r But their characters are ignorant\r of the chapters to come. You know\r where their prayers will lead.\r  \r III.   A circle. Six Nazis. Your wife in the middle.\r One soldier says all Jewesses are whores\r and the others agree. You say nothing.\r Years later you'll decide to speak:\r "Do we not serve Hitler's purpose, we\r who would sooner renounce our beliefs\r than assume our burdens?"\r  \r IV.   A generation after the Holocaust\r and I know no Hebrew. No Yiddish. No Torah.\r I fast only on the Day of Atonement\r and even then I've been known to cheat.\r A generation after the Holocaust\r and I apologize for my grandfather's\r bent back and wild gestures.\r I used to tremble to the rhythm\r of his prayers. I feared the mysterious\r words that kept us from the devil.\r Now, from my window I watch Nazis march.\r Their feet strike the pavement\r like the ticking of a clock. I am a Jew\r a generation after the Holocaust.\r Poorer, my grandfather says, without a past\r than he, who has no future.\r  \n	'1979':8 'agre':46,152 'aleichem':114 'apolog':220 'assum':178 'aton':203 'back':41,226 'band':28 'beard':76 'belief':176 'belong':104 'bent':225 'better':35 'bibl':45 'bold':18 'book':107 'boy':32 'branch':85 'burden':180 'chapter':122 'charact':117 'cheat':212 'chicago':16 'circl':134 'clock':269 'come':124 'day':201 'decid':160 'describ':25 'devil':250 'easi':70,91 'even':205 'fast':197 'fear':241 'feet':260 'futur':291 'generat':183,214,275 'gestur':229 'grandfath':40,67,223,281 'hebrew':191 'hitler':167 'holocaust':186,217,278 'home':52 'hoodlum':30 'hunch':42 'ignor':38,119 'ii':66 'iii':132 'iv':181 'jew':2,47,62,273 'jewess':146 'kept':246 'know':126,189 'known':210 'later':157 'lay':54 'lead':131 'like':48,60,82,264 'll':159 'long':75 'love':72 'march':7,14,258 'middl':141 'mysteri':243 'naiveté':98 'nazi':13,136,257 'noth':155 'one':142 'other':151 'palm':84 'past':285 'pavement':263 'peretz':112 'poorer':279 'pray':59 'prayer':129,239 'purpos':169 'rabbin':101 'read':109 'renounc':174 'rhythm':236 'romantic':93 'say':144,154,282 'scout':33 'search':96 'serv':166 'sholom':113 'singer':111 'six':135 'small':27 'soldier':143 'sooner':173 'speak':162 'spiritu':95 'stay':51 'stone':57 'storm':88 'strike':261 'sun':23 'sun-tim':22 'sway':81 'tick':266 'time':24 'torah':195 'trembl':233 'type':19 'undereduc':31 'us':247 'use':231 've':208 'watch':12,256 'way':79 'whore':148 'wife':138 'wild':228 'window':254 'wise':100 'without':283 'word':102,244 'world':97 'would':172 'year':156 'yiddish':193

Where the shift begins at 7AM,     but consciousness has a way of coming round as slowly  As this old computer monitor flickers its dull sixteen colors into being.     On it, the names and numbers of  laundromat and liquor store owners, Fast food managers and lawn care companies; it’s my job     to cold call them, read from a script on the benefits of membership In the Executive Dining Club, not take No for an answer.     I’m no good and both the boss and I know it, and he’s hovering When the scraped-out voice of  the woman on my phone answers me with     My husband’s been killed, and then, instead of  hanging up,  Throws the receiver down next to something — dishwasher or window AC,     I don’t know — but something close, it sounds, to tearing itself  apart, Something cycling through an awful, screeching noise.     And it’s because I’ve paused that the boss flings a pencil Into the wall in front of  me and edges closer, and because of  the fear     of  unemployment forms or the sky opening up if  I were to walk out, And because this sound — the un-oiled, flak-fouled crack of  it —     has left me standing suddenly at the end of a runway, planes Screaming low overhead and loaded for the beginning of  the end of the world,     that I start back into the script, start back as if  I believe each word, Even though, in the rattle and dust of  the jet-wash, no one hears a thing.\n	'52s':58 '7am':88 'ac':210 'anoth':30 'answer':157,186 'antenna':51 'apart':223 'aw':228 'b':57 'b-52s':56 'back':316,321 'beer':78 'begin':21,86,306 'believ':325 'benefit':144 'boss':165,240 'butteri':27 'call':136 'care':128 'cast':53 'close':217 'closer':253 'cloud':17 'club':151 'cold':47,135 'color':108 'come':95 'compani':129 'comput':102 'conscious':90 'cover':18 'crack':284 'cycl':225 'daybreak':31 'dead':38 'differ':4 'dine':150 'dishwash':207 'dreg':75 'dull':106 'dust':334 'earli':64 'edg':252 'end':294,309 'era':49 'even':328 'execut':149 'fast':123 'fear':258 'flak':282 'flak-foul':281 'flicker':104 'fling':241 'food':124 'form':261 'foul':283 'front':248 'good':161 'hang':198 'head':59 'hear':342 'hover':173 'husband':190 'instead':196 'j':1 'jet':338 'jet-wash':337 'job':133 'kill':193 'know':168,214 'laundromat':118 'lawn':39,127 'layer':16 'learn':2 'left':288 'let':25 'light':28 'like':55 'liquor':120 'load':303 'low':300 'm':159 'malt':70 'malt-o-m':69 'manag':125 'marin':15 'meal':72 'membership':146 'money':10 'monitor':103 'morn':13 'name':114 'neighborhood':45 'next':204 'nois':230 'number':116 'o':71 'offshor':60 'oil':280 'old':101 'one':341 'open':265 'overhead':301 'owner':122 'paus':237 'pencil':243 'phone':185 'plane':298 'poverti':6,62 'rattl':332 'read':138 'receiv':202 'rooftop':42 'round':96 'runway':297 'sag':41 'scrape':177 'scraped-out':176 'scream':299 'screech':229 'script':141,319 'shadow':54 'shift':85 'sink':82 'sixteen':107 'sky':264 'slip':32 'slowli':98 'smell':67 'someth':206,216,224 'sound':219,276 'stand':290 'start':315,320 'still':52 'store':121 'sudden':291 'take':153 'tear':221 'televis':50 'thin':77 'thing':344 'though':329 'throw':200 'un':279 'un-oil':278 'unemploy':260 'unhing':23 've':236 'voic':179 'walk':271 'wall':246 'war':48 'wash':79,339 'way':93 'weigh':35 'window':209 'woman':182 'word':327 'world':312

75	The Man Who Gave Birth to a Panda	46		\nHe had to have it, his mother told him. How could he not, with so few left in the world? He felt heaviest at night with the miracle of it. He was a vessel now. A receptacle for a threatened being. What if he rose too fast and killed it? Or maybe his stillness would do it, too much sitting around, stunned and hungry. And what if the bear emerged alive and another formed in its place, would he have to have that one, too, and another one after that? \r\n \nHe dreamed of the panda’s tiny eyes opening inside him, the doctor’s wide incision, a whirring pain, and then the furry thing emerging, the bear turning to him as to a stranger and whether that would be it—his bit part in the history of the future. \r\n \n \n	'aliv':79 'anoth':81,95 'around':69 'bear':77,125 'birth':5 'bit':140 'could':19 'doctor':111 'dream':100 'emerg':78,123 'eye':106 'fast':55 'felt':30 'form':82 'furri':121 'futur':147 'gave':4 'heaviest':31 'histori':144 'hungri':72 'incis':114 'insid':108 'kill':57 'left':25 'man':2 'mayb':60 'miracl':36 'mother':15 'much':67 'night':33 'one':92,96 'open':107 'pain':117 'panda':8,103 'part':141 'place':85 'receptacl':45 'rose':53 'sit':68 'still':62 'stranger':132 'stun':70 'thing':122 'threaten':48 'tini':105 'told':16 'turn':126 'vessel':42 'whether':134 'whir':116 'wide':113 'world':28 'would':63,86,136

85	Days I Delighted in Everything	55		\nI was listening to a book on tape while driving\r and when the author said, “Those days I delighted in everything,”\r I pulled over and found a pencil and a parking ticket stub\r because surely there was a passage of life where I thought\r “These days I delight in everything,” right there in the\r present, because they almost all feel like that now,\r memory having markered only the outline while evaporating\r the inner anxieties of earlier times.

109	Gate	68		\nEveryone has a cousin Benjamin Bunny.\r Peter said a walk would do him good.\r The edge of the wood. Peter did not\r enjoy himself anymore. He never would\r again. The brooding lettuces\r in their falcon hoods. The coppice gate\r  \r wound shut by weeds, the jaws of life\r trying to keep it closed tight\r but anyone can climb it.\r As a child I played on a gate\r in a neighborhood park\r that swung of itself\r  \r and sounded like the distress\r call of a rabbit. I stood on the bottom slat\r and backed in and out of\r the air. I’ll never get out of here.\r The gate was pure folly, without\r fencing on either side,\r  \r Greek tragedy\r staged around a doorway\r the imagination strains to enter.\r I was raised in an aisle seat\r with an eye line of an actor\r about to come through\r  \r from behind it. Melodramatic\r onions grew wild.\r I cried and cried until someone said\r it’s okay to cry,\r it means the onions\r are fresh. Every dream begins\r  \r with a threshold.\r Meat in the driveway\r where dogs tipped the garbage.\r Where’s your mouth? There is a whistle\r you can buy that makes the sound\r of a rabbit screaming\r  \r hunters use to call\r whatever they want\r out of the thicket\r because everything they want\r wants rabbit for dinner.\r Move your hand\r  \r along the shaft to change\r the call from jack to cotton-\r tail and back again.\r Once you see them nose\r out of the interior at your bidding\r what stops you from sounding\r  \r every single day? All day? The shrill\r imagined rabbit’s\r canned terror. You can do it\r with a reed of grass. Cup your hands.\r Everything alive\r is listening. I knew a hunter\r  \r who could do a spot-on fawn\r whose suffering\r would bring a doe\r into the open every time.\r He didn’t want a doe, though.\r He wanted a buck.\r  \r Here’s what I can’t stand\r to acknowledge:\r when bucks hear\r the sound of the fawn\r my friend makes with his mouth\r they come, too, not in pity, but in lust,\r  \r so badly they want the doe\r drawn by the yearning\r of a fawn in need of her.\r Everything is within range\r suddenly, and who am I to judge.\r He mounts her relief\r  \r and spring comes.\r No. He takes\r a bullet.

112	Wisdom	69		\n      For the young man who would have\r myrrh from a woman,\r and cinnamon and aloes,\r  \r smoother than oil is her mouth. She flatters him with it.\r Between her lips lies death.\r The young man learns that as his bride he should instead have taken\r Wisdom to him.\r Wisdom is the words that figure her as\r  \r fear of the Lord.\r She has seen Israel choose the ways of the oppressor.\r The young men\r Strangeness would claim\r  \r She instructs.\r Wisdom pleads with them at the city gates that when\r pride comes,\r  \r then comes shame.\r Let a man meet rather\r with a bear and her whelps\r than with folly.\r Withhold not\r  \r good from those to whom it is due.\r The Lord’s eyes are on\r  \r every place,\r as on\r Hell and destruction. Whose\r  \r order was it\r that made the ends of the earth?\r Who put clothes on the deep?\r What is his name, and what is his\r  \r son’s name,\r if you can tell?\r  \r Wisdom can. Still a child,\r she attended God when God had not yet\r divided the waters.\r It was no one but\r God’s to do\r to divide what\r  \r isn’t said\r from what is.\r If God was\r male already,\r  \r Wisdom was not male.\r (It may have been Wisdom’s\r difference from God that let God speak\r  \r good into being.)\r Wisdom\r was God’s delight.\r She was with him over the waters.\r The still unformed\r  \r deep would have lasted\r had God not given it form.\r It made God tremble that His call for it to be\r light there\r would not let\r  \r night touch day. (There had to be room\r between them\r or they couldn’t be what\r  \r God said they were.)\r God and\r Wisdom were two.\r Day and night were two also.\r Day gave it to be seen at once that\r  \r down was\r and\r  \r up.\r The deep had a face.\r God’s breath\r  \r hovered over it until there was\r  \r wind there instead.\r The wind is in force in\r many places over the earth’s dry land.\r Its going\r on like that\r is so it too can have extension\r and still not be seen.\r  \r A door woke me.\r It was having to\r open and then flap shut against\r the stable’s north wall.\r  \r some thuds were back-to-back. After others,\r  \r there’d be\r a minute or more of only the wind.\r  \r The wind had become something the trees had had between them for\r days now.\r They’d showed to their tops that they’d be moved\r only so much.\r At the same time that it was many trees,\r  \r the night wind I was hearing them in was\r one. (One has to be the number\r God has\r against the too-many-to-count.)\r  \r If it had a back to it\r in those places how far north where\r right then it was quiet,\r  \r the wind’s broad front was as high as\r just below God.\r (That’s where God starts to be a different\r nothing than wind.)\r If nothing’s\r  \r around the wind to any of its sides,\r Wisdom confides that\r God’s around all. Inside all God holds,\r  \r Wisdom’s at the work of meaning for the faithful that there’s\r good to be had,\r if God’s heeded.\r I wanted to be asleep so I wouldn’t go on making\r  \r God up out of the wind.\n	'alo':16 'alreadi':201 'also':293 'around':502,515 'asleep':546 'attend':169 'back':378,380,460 'back-to-back':377 'bear':101 'becom':397 'breath':314 'bride':40 'broad':478 'call':253 'child':167 'choos':65 'cinnamon':14 'citi':85 'claim':76 'cloth':144 'come':90,92 'confid':511 'couldn':275 'count':455 'd':384,409,416 'day':265,288,294,406 'death':32 'deep':147,237,308 'delight':226 'destruct':130 'differ':212,495 'divid':176,189 'door':356 'dri':336 'due':117 'earth':141,334 'end':138 'everi':124 'extens':349 'eye':121 'face':311 'faith':530 'far':467 'fear':57 'figur':54 'flap':366 'flatter':24 'folli':107 'forc':328 'form':246 'front':479 'gate':86 'gave':295 'given':244 'go':339,551 'god':170,172,184,198,214,217,224,242,249,279,283,312,447,486,490,513,519,539,554 'good':110,219,534 'hear':436 'heed':541 'hell':128 'high':482 'hold':520 'hover':315 'insid':517 'instead':43,323 'instruct':78 'isn':191 'israel':64 'land':337 'last':240 'learn':36 'let':94,216,262 'lie':31 'light':258 'like':341 'lip':30 'lord':60,119 'made':136,248 'make':553 'male':200,205 'man':5,35,96 'mani':330,429,453 'may':207 'mean':527 'meet':97 'men':73 'minut':387 'mouth':22 'move':418 'much':421 'myrrh':9 'name':151,158 'night':263,290,432 'north':372,468 'noth':496,500 'number':446 'oil':19 'one':182,440,441 'open':363 'oppressor':70 'order':132 'other':382 'place':125,331,465 'plead':80 'pride':89 'put':143 'quiet':474 'rather':98 'right':470 'room':270 'said':193,280 'seen':63,299,354 'shame':93 'show':410 'shut':367 'side':509 'smoother':17 'someth':398 'son':156 'speak':218 'stabl':370 'start':491 'still':165,235,351 'strang':74 'taken':45 'tell':162 'thud':375 'time':425 'too-many-to-count':451 'top':413 'touch':264 'tree':400,430 'trembl':250 'two':287,292 'unform':236 'wall':373 'want':543 'water':178,233 'way':67 'whelp':104 'whose':131 'wind':321,325,393,395,433,476,498,504,559 'wisdom':1,46,49,79,163,202,210,222,285,510,521 'withhold':108 'woke':357 'woman':12 'word':52 'work':525 'would':7,75,238,260 'wouldn':549 'yet':175 'young':4,34,72

115	The World	71		\nWhen I learned I could own a piece of The World\r I got my chequebook out. Eternal life belongs to those\r who live in the present. My wife's bright eye affirmed it.\r As do the soothing neutral tones and classic-contemporary\r decor of our professionally designed apartments,\r private verandahs before which the globe, endlessly\r and effortlessly circumnavigated, slips by, allowing residents\r no end of exotic ports, a new destination every few days\r to explore with a depth we hadn't thought possible.\r It's not how things are on The World that is mystical,\r not the market and deli, proximity of masseuse\r and sommelier, not the gym, our favourite restaurant,\r our other favourite restaurant, the yacht club, the library,\r the golf pro, the pool, but that it exists at all, a limited\r whole, a logic and a feeling. What looks like freedom\r is, in fact, the perfection of a plan, and property\r a stocktaking laid against us in a measure. The difference\r between a thing thought, and done. One can ignore neither\r the practical applications nor the philosophical significance\r of our onboard jewelry emporium, its $12 million inventory,\r natural yellow diamonds from South Africa no one needs,\r thus satisfying the criteria for beauty. Without which\r there is no life of the mind. What we share, though, transcends\r ownership, our self-improvement guaranteed\r by the itineraries, licensed experts who prepare us\r for each new harbour and beyond, deliver us into the hands\r of native companions on The World's perpetual course.\r The visual field has no limits. And the eye—\r the eye devours. Polar bears, musk oxen, rare thick-billed\r murre. We golfed on the tundra and from The World\r were airlifted to pristine snowfields, clifftops where we dined\r alfresco above frozen seas. The World is the entirety.\r The largest ship ever to traverse the Northwest Passage.\r How the silent energy coursed between us. Fundamental rules\r had changed. Except, with time, it seems a sort of accident—\r natural objects combined in states of affairs, their internal properties. Accusatory randomness and proliferation\r of types, brutal quantity literally brought to our doors.\r Or past them, as if on the OLED high-def screen\r of our circumstances, which hides more than it reveals.\r For what we see could be other than it is.\r Whatever we're able to describe at all could be other\r than it is. Such assaults on our finer feelings require an appeal\r to order, to the exercise of discipline a private Jacuzzi represents,\r from which one might peacefully enjoy the singular euphoria\r of the Panama Canal or long-awaited departure\r from fetid Venice. There is some truth in solipsism, but I fear\r I'm doing it wrong, standing at the rail for ceremonial cast-offs\r thunderously accessorized with Vangelis or "Non, je ne regrette rien,"\r made irritable by appreciative comments about the light.\r In Reykjavík or Cape Town, it's the same. Familiarity\r without intimacy is the cost of privacy, security\r of a thread count so extravagant its extent can no longer\r be detected. Even at capacity, The World is eerily empty:\r its crew of highly trained specialists in housekeeping,\r maintenance, beauty, and cuisine—the heart and soul\r of the endeavour—are largely unseen and likely where the fun is.\r We sit at the captain's table but don't know him. He's Italian.\r I think on my Clarksville boyhood long before EPS, ROE—\r retractable clothesline sunk in concrete, modest backyard\r a staging ground for potential we felt infinite to the degree\r our parents knew it wasn't. The unknown is where we played.\r And while fulfilment of a premeditated outcome\r confers a nearly spiritual comfort of indifference\r to the time of year, a paradise of fruits always in season,\r the span of choice defines its limit, which cannot be exceeded.\r The sea rolls over, props on an elbow, and now is heard\r the small sound of a daydream running softly aground.\r Dissatisfaction, in a Danish sense. On prevailing winds a scent\r of compromise; for one tires of the spacewalk outside\r what is the case. Beyond immediate luxuries\r lives speculation and the tragic impression one is yet\r to be born. It could be when all pursuits have been satisfied,\r life's problems will remain untouched. But doubt exists only\r where questions exist. The World satisfies its own conditions.\r It argues for itself.

130	The Door	74		\nShe never said I’m going to die. I was with her nearly\r every minute that week, reading, sleeping on the cot beside\r  \r the high-tech bed that kept shifting her slight weight\r while the window shadowed over, then grew brighter,\r  \r and she drifted or got changed or was given another\r shot. None of us said it, though finally when\r  \r she was barely talking anymore, I asked something like Mom,are you ready?—I just want Brad to be ok was what\r  \r she replied. I told her he would be, as if her wish\r or mine could preside at his sentencing hearing.\r  \r After that she was almost entirely silent, but when Dad\r came the last afternoon, edgy without a cigarette,\r  \r checking over the monitors, Mom said she wanted to see him\r for a while alone, and he was startled. Pull the door\r  closed, I heard her tell him, and he did. Out in the hall,\r staring at the pattern of alternating tiles, I thought of Saturday\r  \r mornings when Brad and I were little, and Dad and Mom’s\r room would be not just shut for a time, but locked. Secretly\r  \r I tried the knob once. In that house nobody was allowed\r to lock a door but Dad. Grandma would shoo us to the TV\r  \r with cinnamon toast to watch cartoons, one fool panic after\r the next—bolted dungeons, lies and threats, a saw-blade\r  \r inching toward the tied-up body. Then real people like us,\r finally: Roy Rogers saving them with his amazing calm.\n	'afternoon':119 'allow':204 'almost':110 'alon':138 'altern':164 'amaz':258 'anoth':54 'anymor':68 'ask':70 'bare':66 'bed':30 'besid':25 'blade':238 'bodi':245 'bolt':230 'brad':80,172 'brighter':44 'calm':259 'came':116 'cartoon':223 'chang':50 'check':124 'cigarett':123 'cinnamon':219 'close':146 'cot':24 'could':100 'dad':115,178,210 'die':10 'door':2,145,208 'drift':47 'dungeon':231 'edgi':120 'entir':111 'everi':16 'final':62,251 'fool':225 'given':53 'go':8 'got':49 'grandma':211 'grew':43 'hall':158 'hear':105 'heard':148 'high':28 'high-tech':27 'hous':201 'inch':239 'kept':32 'knob':197 'last':118 'lie':232 'like':72,249 'littl':176 'lock':192,206 'm':7 'mine':99 'minut':17 'mom':73,128,180 'monitor':127 'morn':170 'near':15 'never':4 'next':229 'nobodi':202 'none':56 'ok':83 'one':224 'panic':226 'pattern':162 'peopl':248 'presid':101 'pull':143 'read':20 'readi':76 'real':247 'repli':87 'roger':253 'room':182 'roy':252 'said':5,59,129 'saturday':169 'save':254 'saw':237 'saw-blad':236 'secret':193 'see':133 'sentenc':104 'shadow':40 'shift':33 'shoo':213 'shot':55 'shut':187 'silent':112 'sleep':21 'slight':35 'someth':71 'stare':159 'startl':142 'talk':67 'tech':29 'tell':150 'though':61 'thought':167 'threat':234 'tie':243 'tied-up':242 'tile':165 'time':190 'toast':220 'told':89 'toward':240 'tri':195 'tv':217 'us':58,214,250 'want':79,131 'watch':222 'week':19 'weight':36 'window':39 'wish':97 'without':121 'would':92,183,212
131	Offerings	74		\nYears since I’d been back\r to the memorial; I’d forgotten\r  \r it was up on a rise above\r the killing ground. Two kids\r  \r appeared in the dust with things\r to sell—once coming from the far\r  \r end of the chain-link, two kinds\r of dream-catchers hanging\r  \r from his arm; and the girl, hunched\r on the broken steps under\r  \r the arch’s improbable cross, cradling\r a Tupperware bowl of beaded\r  \r star-necklaces in her lap. Her pink-\r and-silver t-shirt read PRINCESS.\r  \r I shut my car door, and a grouse\r startled off the fence, veered away\r  \r over bent switchgrass. The girl—\r Allie—said her little sisters made\r  \r the jewelry, in the gray house\r at the base of the hill; maybe\r  \r her price included the pictures I\r walked behind her to take: the marker\r  \r for 1890, then the more recent\r graves, in ground seared and\r  \r hardpanned by wind and snow and\r desolation; tied, bandana-pouches\r  \r of tobacco, and ribbons, like fists\r and fingers shifting and fluttering;\r  \r a few tough bright flowers left;\r gray-blue sky rolling above\r  \r to the edges of horizon all around,\r spitting, cooking up a storm.\r  \r I stood and turned back toward\r the arch again, where Allie and\r  \r her friend, if he was a friend, hadn’t\r spoken a word to one another.\r  \r For the first time in my life\r I wished I’d had some cigarettes—\r  \r to smoke with them, at least offer,\r something to do with strangers you\r  \r might sit a while beside till maybe\r one of you thought of something\r  \r to say. A little thunder crackled,\r and we said goodbye; I drove on\r  \r toward the shaft of rain above\r Manderson.  No reason to think I’d\r  \r be any memory to them; a dream-\r catcher sold, a brilliant blue\r  \r necklace. I passed a knocked-overvote Democrat sign, and two younger\r  \r kids working on a bike upside-down,\r and remembered the small bowls,\r  \r empty now, brought and offered\r at the graves surrounded for miles\r  \r by graves never found.

The fridge sweat with orangeade,\r the trees whooped some nights in rain—\r  \r a kid down the street kept coughing into his mitt.\r Static sounds from Comiskey and Fenway came\r though the vinyl, the plastic, the pillow—\r  \r So when it left Stallard’s hand, when Roger Maris’s arms whipped\r the bat and the bullet-arc carried into the chasm the disaffections\r at 344 ft. near the bullpen fence\r  \r under the green girder holding up the voices rising into the façade and over the\r      river\r where a Baptist choir on Lenox Ave. was sending up a variation of Sweet Chariot\r into the traffic on the FDR that was jammed at the Triboro\r  \r where a derrick was broken and the cables of its arms picked up the star-blast of\r      voices coming over the Stadium façade spilling down the black next-game\r      sign into the vector\r of a tilted Coke bottle on a billboard\r  \r at the edge of the river where a cloud of pigeons rose over Roosevelt Island.\r It was evening by the time the cars unjammed and the green of the outfield unfroze\r and the white arc had faded into skyline before fall came\r  \r full of boys throwing themselves onto the turf with inexplicable desire\r for the thing promised.

148	Slum Drummers, Nairobi	31		\n         1.\r  \r What were we watching on the tube under mildewed ceilings in Eastlands?\r A Kenyan guy shaking a rattle made from a can\r while another guy in the band was talking to the queen\r  \r about making sound out of anything? The queen smiled.\r The Jubilee receiving line filed through.\r  \r  \r          2.\r  \r We shimmied past tin shacks selling wigs and bananas, coke and goat lungs;\r  \r the tine of a kalimba kissed my face. My face kissed the blue plastic of\r a soda bottle sliding down a hill of glass.\r  \r I paid the gang leaders for protection\r and we walked into the hills of airplane garbage,\r  \r black and blue plastic bags glowing in the sun spray over the heads\r of the marabou stalking the mounds with their knife-blade beaks.\r  \r  \r          3.\r  \r Stevie Wonder and Elton John moved through the Jubilee line.\r Prince Charles thanked God for the weather as the camera cut\r to fireworks spewing over Hyde Park and then to an image of Nairobi\r and the Slum Drummers picking metal out of the collages of garbage.\r  \r  \r          4.\r  \r My jeans were charred from the tin-can fires,\r and the grilling pig guts when some men looked up from scraps of wire—\r  \r and you went back and forth with them in Swahili before they offered us\r some sizzling fat, before we thanked them with our coy smiles and moved on\r      with Michael who took us\r  \r down a maze of alleyways where tin shacks were floating\r on polymers and nitrogen and a dozen pigs from nowhere snouted the garbage.\r  \r  \r          5.\r  \r You were saying “Dad”—when a marabou-hacked bag shot some shit\r on our shoes—“Dad, kinship roles are always changing”—\r  \r when a woman asked us for a few shillings and salt\r for her soup. Salt? Did I hear her right? Or was it Swahili\r for something else? And through the sooty wind of charcoal fires\r  \r and creaking rusty tin you were saying, “Hannah Arendt called Swahilia degraded language of former slave holders.”\r  \r In the soot of my head—I was listening—\r and Michael was asking for more shillings for the gang guys\r  \r who were “a little fucked up,” he said, “but needed help”—\r and when I turned around the heads of chickens\r  \r were twitching, the feathers fluttering down on oozing sludge;\r “Arendt called it a nineteenth century kind of no language,”\r  \r you were saying, “spoken”—as we were jolted\r by a marabou eating a shoe—“spoken—by the Arab ivory and slave caravans.”\r  \r  \r          6.\r  \r Out of bottles, cans, pipes, mangled wire—the Slum Drummers\r twisted and hacked, joined and seamed their heaven\r  \r into the black plastic ghost of a mashed pot.\r Pure tones blew from the vibrato holes\r  \r like wind through Makadara\r where the breath of God flew through sewage pipes.\r  \r I heard in a tubophone the resurrection\r of ten men rising out of coal and pig snouts\r  \r into the blue Kenyan sky where a marabou\r  \r swallowed a purse—and a woman’s conga\r was parting at the seams above boiling soup cans.\r  \r  \r          7.\r  \r Down a slope of stinking plastic you kept on about Arendt—\r “a hybrid mixture of Bantu with enormous Arab borrowings”\r  \r I could say poa poa  sawa sawa  karibu.\r  \r We could make a kalimba out of a smashed pot\r and pour beans into a can and shake it for the queen.\r  \r Yesterday in the soundless savannah the wildebeests and zebras\r seemed to float through the green-gold grass toward Tanzania.\r  \r We could hear a lion breathe; we could hear wind through tusks.\r  \r  \r          8.\r  \r On TV the guys were grinning into metal go-go drums;\r hammering twisted sewage pipes and cut wire like sailors from Mombasa—\r harder nailed than da Gama’s voyage down the Arab trade coast—\r  \r  \r          9.\r  \r So, where are we—in a slum of no language?\r Walking through steam shovels of light, breaking over\r mounds of metal as if the sky were just blue plastic?\r  \r Isn’t English just a compost heap of devouring grammar,\r joined, hacked, bruised words, rotting on themselves?\r  \r I keep following you, daughter of scrutiny, into plastic fields of carrion\r  \r between sight and site, vision not visionary, pig guts on the grill,\r  \r trying to keep balance\r between streams of sewage and the sky,\r  \r as you keep hacking, Sophia, at the de-centered,\r the burning text, anthropology’s shakedown.\r  \r A marabou just knifed the arm of a woman picking\r bottles out of plastic bags.\r  \r A rooster crows from under a pile\r of galvanized tin as if it were morning on a farm.\n	'1':4 '2':53 '3':132 '4':179 '5':260

Those beautiful letters live in Paris all year around.\r For even the best of men go astray with words within the gentle depths\r When they are to express something unutterable.\r But I believe nevertheless that you need not be left without them as a\r Part of me, as a recreation between hesitations,\r The boundless ones in moments of doubts.\r  \r If you have this affection for things that don't really matter to the poor,\r Then everything will become clear, more coherent and somehow more\r Conciliatory, not perhaps how I manage to function from day to day\r Taking Kenneth's last words to be my daily gospel that "we must write\r Every day," but in your innermost consciousness and wakefulness you will\r Know I have patience with these black lines that I share with my most\r Intimate friends to say I'm still writing to you.\r So I sincerely beg you to have no remorse with matters of the heart,\r For it is a foolish, overbearing organ that does not have a place to rest\r Except in our sleep with dreams it cannot have during our times of\r Playful awareness. I only seek, as well as I can, to serve the last\r Wishes as a poet. What else is one to do with these unsolved hearts on\r Paper?

156	Zoloft	78		\nTwo weeks into the bottle of pills, I'd remember\r exiting the one-hour lens grinder at Copley Square—\r the same store that years later would be blown\r back and blood-spattered by a backpack\r bomb at the marathon. But this was back when\r terror happened elsewhere. I walked out\r wearing the standard Boston graduate student\r wire-rims, my first-ever glasses, and saw little people\r in office tower windows working late under fluorescent\r lights. File cabinets with drawer seams blossomed\r wire bins, and little hands answered little black\r telephones, rested receivers on bloused shoulders—\r real as the tiny flushing toilets, the paneled wainscotting\r and armed candelabras I gasped at as a child in \r the miniature room at the Art Institute in Chicago.\r It was October and I could see the edges\r of everything—where the branches had been a blur\r of fire, now there were scalloped oak leaves, leathery\r maple five-points plain as on the Canadian flag.\r When the wind lifted the leaves the trees went pale,\r then dark again, in waves.

162	My Nodebook for December	80		\n                  1\r  \r Closing the door is supposed to open some\r inward source—as with, for example, the prayer-\r closet: the text says go in and “shut thy door.”\r It's a stroke of luck when traditional\r wisdom so matches the turning of the season.\r  \r  \r                   2\r  \r I've ofen thought of writing a poem of grotesque\r length (an epic, yes) and setting the entire argument\r the instant after Gautama's enlightenment, while\r it seemed to him he would pass directly\r into Nirvana, while the powers of good trembled\r thinking man was lost. It was only an\r instant, because of course the Buddha\r reconsidered.\r  \r  \r                   3\r  \r Bulls for the bull-fight must (this is\r absolutely essential) be\r innocent. The very brightest are certainly,\r by human standards, stupid, but\r after a few fights the\r dullest among them would learn not to\r charge an empty cape but turn and\r massacre the fancy-pants who dances there\r for a bloody crowd. But, as Hemingway\r noted, the bull never survives. I can't, myself, get\r excited about “life and death, i.e., violent\r death,” and have never been able to\r work up much sympathy for\r the brute who runs with his\r head down or for the show-off, who\r has it coming. I'll probably never\r develop a taste for battle or\r get seven novels written or kill myself.\r  \r  \r                   4\r  \r History is hard for me. I’ve no\r sense for it.\r  \r  \r                   5\r  \r The world—and if ever there was a self-evident\r proposition, here it is—the worldis a big fish. I've caught it in\r my net. And now, long into the winter\r nights, wearily, I study my net.\r The fish stinks.\r  \r  \r                   6\r  \r A friend talks passionately in favor of\r silence. I listen to him. He says, “Silence\r dissolves the categories” and “Silence renews\r the potential of consciousness.” And it strikes me\r that I should say something.\r But I've never been able to argue. And whenever there’s\r been a choice between speaking and keeping still,\r I’ve kept my mouth shut. Well,\r usually. And only after\r a certain amount of prodding I’ve\r produced the necessary conventional sounds,\r feeling the thread of words I spew\r inordinately fragile, certainly nothing\r to depend on. Whereas the craw of\r silence is vast and, anyway,\r already has us—it’s the scorching sunlight\r of a Nilescape or the wind across the Great\r Plains, burying us. Friend, waist deep in dust or\r sand, maybe we’d contrive a gesture.\r  \r  \r                   7\r  \r I passed the peak of my\r energy at the age of—it's\r hard to believe—\r twelve. Since then,\r little by little, I've collected\r the furniture of my house.\r I teach meanwhile, and I\r study, but no one knows\r my specialty.\r  \r  \r                   8 XMAS [after Pessoa]\r  \r A God is born. Some other Gods die. Truth\r has neither come nor gone, only the Error has changed.\r We have now another Eternity,\r and the world is no better off than it was.\r Blind Knowing plows a sterile plain\r Lunatic Faith lives a dream of worship.\r A new God is nothing but a word.\r Seek not. Nor believe. All is occult.\r  \r  \r                   9\r  \r Time is molecular—so much for\r Zeno—and each moment brings everything\r out of nothing. In the beginning (each\r beginning) the universe is only a\r point—no dimension—and then\r it’s a world, for a moment, and\r each moment is apocalypse. Continuous creation it used to be called, and now\r we say expanding universe because (I\r forgot to say) each moment is more. Whatever else it may\r be, it's always more. No wonder the poet cries\r “Oh,Oh,”\r or, on a higher level, lyrical verses. But don’t\r worry. I’m not violent. We all\r live in a residue of\r bright pulsations, a gob\r of time, an after-image.\r  \r  \r                   10\r  \r How naive can you get?—I\r was wondering, when the Great\r Year comes around to this point again\r and the next me sits signing his\r poems Keith Waldrop, will he\r remember back across the void\r of Decembers to where I drift into these\r speculations? And a moment’s\r thought answers my stupid question: I\r remember nothing.\r  \r  \r                   11\r  \r When I think of the books you could\r fill with what I don’t know, oof. The pressing need’s\r for a phenomenology of ignorance. Everything has\r horizons, and they’re not just\r out of sight, they loom. Yes, and they beckon.\r An open door is plain and simple, like a\r wall. A closed door is an invitation. But if\r the knob is turning . . . ?\r Well, I’m closing in, or opening up. I’ve been so\r bloody finicky the mysteries catch me sometimes\r with my lids down. But I’m preparing. I need\r many voices for my revenge.\n	'1':5 '10':639 '11':696 '2':48 '3':106 '4':228 '5':240 '6':283 '7':417 '8':460 '9':526 'abl':186,323 'absolut':116 'across':398,672 'after-imag':636 'age':427 'alreadi':384 'alway':598 'among':136 'amount':351 'anoth':486 'answer':689 'anyway':383 'apocalyps':568 'argu':325 'argument':67 'around':653 'back':671 'battl':219 'beckon':738 'begin':544,546 'believ':433,522 'better':493 'big':259 'blind':498 'bloodi':159,773 'book':702 'born':467 'bright':629 'brightest':122 'bring':537 'brute':194 'buddha':104 'bull':107,111,166 'bull-fight':110 'buri':402 'call':575 'cape':145 'catch':777 'categori':301 'caught':263 'certain':124,350,370 'chang':482 'charg':142 'choic':332 'close':6,750,764 'closet':22 'collect':442 'come':210,475,652 'conscious':308 'continu':569 'contriv':414 'convent':359 'could':704 'cours':102 'craw':377 'creation':570 'cri':604 'crowd':160 'd':413 'danc':155 'death':178,181 'decemb':4,676 'deep':406 'depend':373 'develop':215 'die':471 'dimens':554 'direct':82 'dissolv':299 'door':8,31,741,751 'dream':508 'drift':680 'dullest':135 'dust':408 'els':592 'empti':144 'energi':424 'enlighten':73 'entir':66 'epic':61 'error':480 'essenti':117 'etern':487 'ever':245 'everyth':538,722 'evid':251 'exampl':19 'excit':174 'expand':580 'faith':505 'fanci':152 'fancy-p':151 'favor':289 'feel':361 'fight':112,133 'fill':705 'finicki':774 'fish':260,281 'forgot':584 'fragil':369 'friend':285,404 'furnitur':444 'gautama':71 'gestur':416 'get':173,221,644 'go':26 'gob':632 'god':465,470,513 'gone':477 'good':89 'great':400,650 'grotesqu':58 'hard':231,431 'head':199 'hemingway':163 'higher':610 'histori':229 'horizon':724 'hous':447 'human':126 'i.e':179 'ignor':721 'imag':638 'innoc':119 'inordin':368 'instant':69,99 'invit':754 'inward':14 'keep':336 'keith':666 'kept':340 'kill':226 'knob':758 'know':457,499,711 'learn':139 'length':59 'level':611 'lid':782 'life':176 'like':746 'listen':293 'littl':437,439 'live':506,624 'll':212 'long':270 'loom':734 'lost':94 'luck':37 'lunat':504 'lyric':612 'm':619,763,786 'man':92 'mani':790 'massacr':149 'match':42 'may':594 'mayb':411 'meanwhil':450 'molecular':529 'moment':536,563,566,588,686 'mouth':342 'much':190,531 'must':113 'mysteri':776 'naiv':641 'necessari':358 'need':715,789 'neither':474 'net':267,279 'never':167,184,214,321 'new':512 'next':660 'night':274 'nilescap':394 'nirvana':84 'nodebook':2 'note':164 'noth':371,515,541,695 'novel':223 'occult':525 'ofen':51 'oh':605,606 'one':456 'oof':712 'open':12,740,767 'pant':153 'pass':81,419 'passion':287 'peak':421 'pessoa':463 'phenomenolog':719 'plain':401,503,743 'plow':500 'poem':56,665 'poet':603 'point':552,656 'potenti':306 'power':87 'prayer':21 'prepar':787 'press':714 'probabl':213 'prod':353 'produc':356 'proposit':252 'pulsat':630 'question':692 're':727 'reconsid':105 'rememb':670,694 'renew':304 'residu':627 'reveng':794 'run':196 'sand':410 'say':25,297,316,579,586 'scorch':390 'season':47 'seek':519 'seem':76 'self':250 'self-evid':249 'sens':237 'set':64 'seven':222 'show':205 'show-off':204 'shut':29,343 'sight':732 'sign':663 'silenc':291,298,303,379 'simpl':745 'sinc':435 'sit':662 'someth':317 'sometim':779 'sound':360 'sourc':15 'speak':334 'specialti':459 'specul':683 'spew':367 'standard':127 'steril':502 'still':337 'stink':282 'strike':311 'stroke':35 'studi':277,453 'stupid':128,691 'sunlight':391 'suppos':10 'surviv':168 'sympathi':191 'talk':286 'tast':217 'teach':449 'text':24 'thi':30 'think':91,699 'thought':52,688 'thread':363 'time':527,634 'tradit':39 'trembl':90 'truth':472 'turn':44,147,760 'twelv':434 'univers':548,581 'us':386,403 'use':572 'usual':345 'vast':381 've':50,235,262,320,339,355,441,770 'vers':613 'violent':180,621 'voic':791 'void':674 'waist':405 'waldrop':667 'wall':748 'wearili':275 'well':344,761 'whatev':591 'whenev':327 'wherea':375 'wind':397 'winter':273 'wisdom':40 'wonder':601,647 'word':365,518 'work':188 'world':242,490,560 'worldi':257 'worri':617 'worship':510 'would':80,138 'write':54 'written':224 'xmas':461 'year':651 'yes':62,735 'zeno':533

written\r across\r her\r face.\r We are\r what we\r are, momentary\r coincidence.\r She is\r body,\r speaking\r through body.\r  \r  \r 9\r She will claim, for\r instance, King\r Solomon planted\r

 \r  \r 11\r She has, it would\r seem, no\r natural\r inclination to rise.\r She is\r whatever I\r cannot get\r rid of.\r She’s whatever\r refuses\r to be\r information.\r She is my\r absence,\r my only secure\r reference.\r  \r  \r 12\r Just when I’m\r ready to let\r go, satisfaction\r is satisfaction.\r Curious text, where\r we’re commanded to acquire\r Nirvana.\r Nothing but\r impatience\r could prompt our\r abrupt recognition.\r she says virginity\r of the mind\r can be\r restored.\r  \r  \r 13\r Let me\r not praise\r her past her\r due.\r She is\r a heap of\r pebbles\r in exquisite random.\r Her laughter\r rings\r empty, where there\r were crowds.\r My arms\r around\r you, my\r love, are phantoms.\r  \r  \r 14\r She appears sometimes\r to be talking\r about\r other data.\r It is as\r if she\r knew a separate\r category.\r I tell\r her, weeping’s\r no proof\r of the resurrection.\r All\r of her is\r curved\r and alters.\r  \r  \r 15\r She can\r only\r be pictured\r as catastrophe.\r She con-\r fuses\r concepts with\r irony.\r Her thought spreads,\r like\r children\r running home.\r She\r finds comfort in\r the most outrageous\r limbs.\r  \r  \r 16\r The moon, according\r to her, is\r a symbol\r for shine.\r Residues\r provide the\r passion\r of thought.\r Her reflexes\r condition\r my\r mythology.\r She is the\r energy\r of my\r indexes.\r  \r  \r 17\r When she\r snarls at\r me, my\r senses sharpen.\r Who could expect\r her,\r without\r lying?\r She is a\r color\r outside\r the octave.\r Her rituals\r divide my\r life\r from its labors.\r  \r  \r 18\r She makes\r the right\r answer\r sound foolish.\r The righteous\r glory\r in their un-\r certainty.\r Two\r nuts represent\r us in\r divination.\r The only\r thing she\r comes home in\r is twilight.\r  \r  \r 19\r She sits\r in the\r street, making\r detours.\r Her history is\r rich\r in in-\r decisions.\r She is\r present,\r inclusive,\r untransformed.\r I do not\r pretend\r to know\r how the flood came.\r  \r  \r 20\r A hymn\r describes the\r monotony\r of her expectations.\r She was\r created\r from the sweat\r of peacocks.\r Children\r defend themselves\r with shame\r and experience.\r All her\r objects\r answer to the\r same name.\r  \r  \r 21\r Better a blank\r wall than\r simple\r dark.\r The play in\r her muscle de-\r termines\r where my eyes focus.\r She\r sleeps at\r the curve\r of my spine.\r She wouldn’t\r believe\r me, if I\r were to tell her.\n	'1':4 '10':324 '11':360 '12':394 '13':432 '14':466 '15':502 '16':531 '17':560 '18':590 '19':620 '2':44 '20':650

164	Six Further Studies	80		\nI\r  \r In heaven there is no more sea, and houses no longer need a widow’s\r walk. And no more widows, there being neither marriage nor giving\r in marriage. How the air hangs lower and lower on this—I hope\r —hottest day of summer. A faintly rotten scent the ground gives off\r brings to mind lilacs that have budded and blossomed. There are no\r more blossoms, perfume and purple gone for a year, as if forever. In\r heaven there are no tears, salt water wiped away entirely. One moment\r I breathe contentment. And then unreasoning sorrow pulses through\r me, an imperfect tension, as if unending. I have time on my hands. In\r heaven there is no more dusk, dark, dawn, meridian. And what I know\r now and for certain: neither the day nor the hour.\r  \r  \r II\r  \r It seems clear enough that there is in the brain a particular pain-center,\r where sensations of every variety check in, to emerge as anguish and\r hurt. Thus there is not, as we might suppose, a multiplicity of pains,\r like an arsenal deployed against us, but one pain which puts on, as in a\r ritual theater, different masks.\r          It need not, even, be a great number of masks, some few faces\r peopling an endless repertory. From one fairy tale to another, is not\r the witch the same witch, whether poisoning an apple or fattening the\r children?\r  \r  \r III\r  \r The doctrine changes, blows here and there, hot, cold. One more\r notion sweeps across the state in gusts, fiercely at first, settling then\r into a mild rotation. It puts things in motion. It dies down, while\r pressure somewhere else is building.\r          Called to, across a chasm of thin air, I shape the air to answer. My\r moments force themselves apart.\r          Breathe out. Breathe in. But as long as you are alive, there is a dead\r space in your lungs, never emptied, never needing to be filled. The spirit\r there, stale and sustaining, holds open every possibility, urging none. Ghost\r money: money to burn.\r  \r  \r IV\r  \r On the earliest known sundial, the finger of shadow moves through\r symbols of the cosmos, but there are no lines drawn to mark off the hours.\r It does not, in the modern sense, “keep” time, but celebrates its flight, its\r recurrence, its brightness.\r  \r  \r V\r  \r Hermaphrodite, sleeping. Predominance, in the visible, of the right hand\r —but the eyes now closed. What could there be to dream about, for one\r already complete? A perfect asymmetrical stability. No need to see or even\r to look.\r          To know, without having to ask. From any point on the periphery,\r advancing always towards the body. Both sexes. And both asleep.\r  \r  \r VI\r  \r A scream from outside broke our argument and I ran to the door, rushed\r out onto the sidewalk almost, I thought, before the scream had ended. The\r night sky, above the street lamp, had a sheen of some dark metal.\r          Sirens—which seemed this evening more frequent than usual, and\r more strident—state the theme, you have said, of our instant: the howl\r of a machine hurrying to disaster. And all day, in the violence of delivery,\r ordinary trucks rattle our sashes.\r          The street lay empty, mercury lit, silence giving us no indication of\r which way to turn.\r  \n	'across':251,281 'advanc':436 'air':35,286,290 'aliv':308 'almost':465 'alreadi':410 'alway':437 'anguish':165 'anoth':221 'answer':292 'apart':297 'appl':232 'argument':453 'arsenal':182 'ask':429 'asleep':445 'asymmetr':414 'away':89 'blossom':64,69 'blow':241 'bodi':440 'brain':149 'breath':94,298,300 'bright':384 'bring':56 'broke':451 'bud':62 'build':278 'burn':340 'call':279 'celebr':378 'center':154 'certain':132 'chang':240 'chasm':283 'check':160 'children':236 'clear':142 'close':400 'cold':246 'complet':411 'content':95 'cosmos':356 'could':402 'dark':122,485 'dawn':123 'day':45,135,518 'dead':312 'deliveri':523 'deploy':183 'die':271 'differ':197 'disast':515 'doctrin':239 'door':459 'drawn':362 'dream':406 'dusk':121 'earliest':344 'els':276 'emerg':163 'empti':318,532 'end':472 'endless':214 'enough':143 'entir':90 'even':202,421,491 'everi':158,332 'eye':398 'face':211 'faint':49 'fairi':218 'fatten':234 'fierc':256 'fill':323 'finger':348 'first':258 'flight':380 'forc':295 'forev':79 'frequent':493 'ghost':336 'give':30,54,536 'gone':73 'great':205 'ground':53 'gust':255 'hand':114,395 'hang':36 'heaven':6,81,116 'hermaphrodit':386 'hold':330 'hope':43 'hot':245 'hottest':44 'hour':138,367 'hous':13 'howl':509 'hurri':513 'hurt':167 'ii':139 'iii':237 'imperfect':104 'indic':539 'instant':507 'iv':341 'keep':375 'know':128,425 'known':345 'lamp':479 'lay':531 'like':180 'lilac':59 'line':361 'lit':534 'long':304 'longer':15 'look':423 'lower':37,39 'lung':316 'machin':512 'mark':364 'marriag':28,32 'mask':198,208 'mercuri':533 'meridian':124 'metal':486 'might':174 'mild':263 'mind':58 'modern':373 'moment':92,294 'money':337,338 'motion':269 'move':351 'multipl':177 'need':16,200,320,417 'neither':27,133 'never':317,319 'night':474 'none':335 'notion':249 'number':206 'one':91,187,217,247,409 'onto':462 'open':331 'ordinari':524 'outsid':450 'pain':153,179,188 'pain-cent':152 'particular':151 'peopl':212 'perfect':413 'perfum':70 'peripheri':435 'point':432 'poison':230 'possibl':333 'predomin':388 'pressur':274 'puls':100 'purpl':72 'put':190,266 'ran':456 'rattl':526 'recurr':382 'repertori':215 'right':394 'ritual':195 'rotat':264 'rotten':50 'rush':460 'said':504 'salt':86 'sash':528 'scent':51 'scream':448,470 'sea':11 'see':419 'seem':141,489 'sens':374 'sensat':156 'settl':259 'sex':442 'shadow':350 'shape':288 'sheen':482 'sidewalk':464 'silenc':535 'siren':487 'six':1 'sky':475 'sleep':387 'somewher':275 'sorrow':99 'space':313 'spirit':325 'stabil':415 'stale':327 'state':253,499 'street':478,530 'strident':498 'studi':3 'summer':47 'sundial':346 'suppos':175 'sustain':329 'sweep':250 'symbol':353 'tale':219 'tear':85 'tension':105 'theater':196 'theme':501 'thin':285 'thing':267 'thought':467 'thus':168 'time':111,376 'toward':438 'truck':525 'turn':544 'unend':108 'unreason':98 'urg':334 'us':185,537 'usual':495 'v':385 'varieti':159 'vi':446 'violenc':521 'visibl':391 'walk':20 'water':87 'way':542 'whether':229 'widow':18,24 'wipe':88 'witch':225,228 'without':426 'year':76

170	Crate	82		\nHalfway between crib and cage the French language puts crate, a simple slatted box for transporting those fruits that fall ill at the least lack of air.\r\nBuilt in such a way that it can be broken down effortlessly after use, it is never used twice. It is really more perishable than the deliquescing foodstuffs that it carries.\r\nOn the corners of streets that lead to the markets, it gleams like white wood without wood’s vanity. Still very new, and slightly surprised to find itself in this awkward position, having been thrown into the gutter without hope of retrieval, it remains a most likable object on whose fate we will not dwell for long.\r\n \nTranslated from the French\n	'air':28 'awkward':90 'box':15 'broken':38 'built':29 'cage':6 'carri':59 'corner':62 'crate':1,11 'crib':4 'deliquesc':55 'dwell':114 'effortless':40 'fall':21 'fate':110 'find':86 'foodstuff':56 'french':8,120 'fruit':19 'gleam':71 'gutter':97 'halfway':2 'hope':99 'ill':22 'lack':26 'languag':9 'lead':66 'least':25 'likabl':106 'like':72 'long':116 'market':69 'never':45 'new':81 'object':107 'perish':52 'posit':91 'put':10 'realli':50 'remain':103 'retriev':101 'simpl':13 'slat':14 'slight':83 'still':79 'street':64 'surpris':84 'thrown':94 'translat':117 'transport':17 'twice':47 'use':42,46 'vaniti':78 'way':33 'white':73 'whose':109 'without':75,98 'wood':74,76
171	Rain	82		\nThe rain, in the backyard where I watch it fall, comes down at different  rates. In the center a fine discontinuous curtain — or network — falls implacably and yet gently in drops that are probably quite light; a strengthless sempiternal precipitation, an intense fraction of the atmosphere at its purest. A little distance from the walls to the right and left plunk heavier drops, one by one. Here they seem about the size of grains of wheat, the size of a pea, while elsewhere they are big as marbles. Along gutters and window frames the rain runs horizontally, while depending from the same obstacles it hangs like individually wrapped candies. Along the entire surface of a little zinc roof under my eyes it trickles in a very thin sheet, a moiré pattern formed by the varying currents created by the imperceptible bumps and undulations of the surface. From the gutter it flows with the restraint of a shallow creek until it tumbles out into a perfectly vertical net, rather imperfectly braided, all the way to the ground where it breaks and sparkles into brilliant needles.\r\nEach of its forms has its particular allure and corresponds to a particular patter. Together they share the intensity of a complex mechanism  as precise as it is dangerous, like a steam-powered clock whose spring is wound by the force of the precipitation.\r\nThe ringing on the ground of the vertical trickles, the glug-glug of the gutters, the miniscule strikes of the gong multiply and resonate all at once in a concert without monotony, and not without a certain delicacy.\r\nOnce the spring unwinds itself certain wheels go on turning for a while, more and more slowly, until the whole mechanism comes to a stop. It all vanishes with the sun: when it finally reappears, the brilliant apparatus evaporates. It has rained.\r\n \nTranslated from the French\n	'allur':193 'along':90,111 'apparatus':307 'atmospher':47 'backyard':6 'big':87 'braid':171 'break':180 'brilliant':184,306 'bump':142 'candi':110 'center':19 'certain':268,275 'clock':220 'come':12,291 'complex':207 'concert':261 'correspond':195 'creat':138 'creek':159 'current':137 'curtain':23 'danger':214 'delicaci':269 'depend':100 'differ':15 'discontinu':22 'distanc':53 'drop':32,64 'elsewher':84 'entir':113 'evapor':308 'eye':122 'fall':11,26 'final':303 'fine':21 'flow':152 'forc':227 'form':133,189 'fraction':44 'frame':94 'french':315 'gentl':30 'glug':242,243 'glug-glug':241 'go':277 'gong':252 'grain':75 'ground':177,235 'gutter':91,150,246 'hang':106 'heavier':63 'horizont':98 'impercept':141 'imperfect':170 'implac':27 'individu':108 'intens':43,204 'left':61 'light':37 'like':107,215 'littl':52,117 'marbl':89 'mechan':208,290 'miniscul':248 'moiré':131 'monotoni':263 'multipli':253 'needl':185 'net':168 'network':25 'obstacl':104 'one':65,67 'particular':192,198 'patter':199 'pattern':132 'pea':82 'perfect':166 'plunk':62 'power':219 'precipit':41,230 'precis':210 'probabl':35 'purest':50 'quit':36 'rain':1,3,96,311 'rate':16 'rather':169 'reappear':304 'reson':255 'restraint':155 'right':59 'ring':232 'roof':119 'run':97 'seem':70 'sempitern':40 'shallow':158 'share':202 'sheet':129 'size':73,79 'slowli':286 'sparkl':182 'spring':222,272 'steam':218 'steam-pow':217 'stop':294 'strengthless':39 'strike':249 'sun':300 'surfac':114,147 'thin':128 'togeth':200 'translat':312 'trickl':124,239 'tumbl':162 'turn':279 'undul':144 'unwind':273 'vanish':297 'vari':136 'vertic':167,238 'wall':56 'watch':9 'way':174 'wheat':77 'wheel':276 'whole':289 'whose':221 'window':93 'without':262,266 'wound':224 'wrap':109 'yet':29 'zinc':118
172	Snails	82		\nUnlike the ashes that make their home with hot coals, snails prefer moist earth. Go on: they advance while gluing themselves to it with their entire bodies. They carry it, they eat it, they shit it. They go through it, it goes through them. It’s the best kind of interpenetration, as between tones, one passive and one active. The passive bathes and nourishes the active, which overturns the other while it eats.\r\n(There is more to be said about snails. First of all their immaculate clamminess. Their sangfroid. Their stretchiness.)\r\nOne can scarcely conceive of a snail outside its shell and unmoving. The moment it rests it sinks down deep into itself. In fact, its modesty obliges it to move as soon as it has shown its nakedness and  revealed its vulnerable shape. The moment it’s exposed, it moves on.\r\nDuring periods of dryness they withdraw into ditches where it seems their bodies are enough to maintain their dampness. No doubt their neighbors there are toads and frogs and other ectothermic animals. But when they come out again they don’t move as quickly. You have to admire their willingness to go into the ditch, given how hard it is for them to come out again.\r\nNote also that though snails like moist soil, they have no affection for places that are too wet such as marshes or ponds. Most assuredly they prefer firm earth, as long as it’s fertile and damp.\r\nThey are fond as well of moisture-rich vegetables and green leafy plants. They know how to feed on them leaving only the veins, cutting free the most tender leaves. They are hell on salads.\r\nWhat are these beings from the depths of the ditches? Though snails love many of their trenches’ qualities they have every intention of leaving. They are in their element but they are also wanderers. And when they emerge into the daylight onto firm ground their shells will preserve their vagabond’s hauteur.\r\nIt must be a pain to have to haul that trailer around with them everywhere, but they never complain and in the end they are happy about it. How valuable, after all, to be able to go home any time, no matter where you may find yourself, eluding all intruders. It must be worth it.\r\nThey are a little vain about this convenient ability: “Look at me, a vulnerable and sensitive being, who is nevertheless protected from unwanted guests, and so always in possession of happiness and peace of mind!” It’s not surprising the snail holds his head so high.\r\n“At the same time I am glued to the earth, always touching it, always progressing, though slowly, and always capable of pulling loose from the soil into myself. Après moi le déluge, I don’t care, the slightest kick may roll me anywhere. I can always get up again onto my single foot and reglue myself to the dirt where fate has planted me, and that’s my pantry: the earth, the most common of foods.”\r\nJoy to the snail! But they leave their proud slime on everything they touch. A silvery trail follows them. And maybe this points the way for the beaks of birds that love to eat them. Ay, there’s the rub: “To be or not to be, that is the question!” Such vanity! But that’s the danger they face.\r\nAlone? Yes, the snail is quite alone. He has few friends. But he needs no friends to be happy. He sticks to Nature, he enjoys his perfect nearness, he is the friend of the soil which he kisses with his whole body. And he befriends the leaves, and the heavens toward which he proudly stretches his head, with eyes sensitive enough to signify nobility, slowness, wisdom, pride, vanity, fire.\r\nNo, he is nothing like the pig. He lacks those pitiful little scurrying anxious feet. That needful flight from shame. The stoic snail is tougher than that. He is more methodical, more proud, and without  a doubt less gluttonous than any pig — pigs after all are capricious, leaving behind one bit of food to chase after something else. That  panicky, hurried gluttony, that fear of missing out on something — that’s not for the snail.\r\nNothing could be more beautiful than that deliberate and discreet advance. What it must cost them to glide so perfectly along the earth they honor with their presence! Each is like a ship trailing its silver wake. They proceed with a majesty that is all the more complete when you consider again the vulnerability of those highly sensitive eyeballs.\r\nIs the anger of snails perceptible? What examples can be found? As it makes no other gestures, the snail’s passion can probably only be discovered by a more profuse and rapid effusion of slime. The slime of pride. So one can see the expression of their rage is identical with that of their egotism. So they rule the world in their rich and silvery fashion.\r\nThe expression of their anger, like that of their pride, shines as it dries. But it also makes the trail that reveals them to predators. What’s more, this trail is ephemeral and lasts only until the next rain.\r\nThat’s how it is with everyone who speaks in an entirely subjective way, in verses and lines only, without taking care to build their phrases  into a solid dwelling with more than two dimensions. Something more durable than themselves.\r\nBut undoubtedly they don’t feel this need. They are heroes, that is to say beings whose existence alone is a work of art — not artists who merely make masterpieces.\r\nHere I touch on one of the main points of their lesson, something they have in common with all shelled beings: that shell, part of their essence, is at the same time a work of art, a monument. It lasts longer than they do.\r\nThat is the example that snails offer us: saints who make masterpieces  of their lives, works of art of their own perfection. They secrete form. Nothing outside themselves, their necessity, or their needs is their work. Nothing is out of proportion with their physical being. Nothing that is unnecessary or obligatory.\r\nAnd so they delineate the duties of humanity: great thoughts come from the heart. Live a better life and make better verses. Morality and rhetoric combine in the ambition and desire of the wise.\r\nHow are they saints? Precisely by obedience to their nature. So: know yourself. And accept yourself for what you are. In agreement with your vices. In proportion with your measure.\r\nWhat is most appropriate to the human being? Words. Decency. Our humanism.\r\n \r\n\r\nTranslated from the French\n	'abil':398 'abl':369 'accept':1092 'activ':60,67 'admir':191 'advanc':19,725 'affect':221 'agreement':1099 'alon':571,577,937 'along':735

She'll go: undeniable\r as these bones, baffling as what animal they'd make. She's on all\r fours. The way I labored: some wild thing. She lays out arms and\r legs; the bones in line make a spine.

Night has no dilution anxieties,\r but only the infinites are happy:\r Math. Time. Everything happy goes\r to many decimal places\r while flesh passes through\r gradations of glory. I visualized it,\r the nurse said of the bedsore. Everything exists\r at the courtesy of everything else.\r Please see that my grave is kept clean.\r Beloveds, finite things\r in which the infinite endangered itself,\r excarnate to memory and the divine substance\r has limited liability. You're kind,\r I tell the infinite. Too kind.\n	'angelectomi':3 'anxieti':103 'bedsor':134 'belov':151 'bitter':19 'black':55,94 'clean':150 'complianc':50 'courtesi':139 'cube':39 'day':36 'decim':117 'delint':53 'denim':56 'die':70 'dilut':102 'dim':64 'divin':165 'dream':85 'dri':29 'dust':97 'duti':38 'els':142 'endang':158 'everi':46 'everyth':112,135,141 'excarn':160 'exist':136 'finit':152 'flesh':120 'flouresc':60 'gall':14 'glori':125 'goe':114 'gradat':123 'grave':147 'grudg':15 'happi':109,113 'highlight':62 'infinit':107,157,176 'iron':18 'kept':149 'kind':172,178 'liabil':169 'limit':168 'm':68,89 'major':61 'mani':116 'math':110 'mean':21 'meant':75 'memori':162 'mind':47 'miniatur':25,33 'minor':66 'night':99 'nurs':130 'optim':48 'organ':7 'pass':121 'place':34,118 'pleas':91,143 're':171 'said':131 'say':23 'see':92,144 'sleep':83,90 'sliver':16 'stuff':58,95 'substanc':166 'task':44 'tell':174 'thing':153 'time':40,42,51,111 'tire':79 'travel':57 'vener':9 'visual':127 'wailbon':17 'waterfal':26 'wormwood':12 'write':77 'wrote':72

Countdown\rIn your hospital bed, the plastic mask across\rYour face siphoning air into your lungs,\rYou lie helpless as an astronaut\rBlasting into space: Eyes oblivious\rTo ours, your body's fevered presence\rShimmers like the phantom heat that will trail\rUp the pipe of the crematory oven:\rHow distant we will seem after\rSuch intensity ... We drift in your stare\rLike the dust stirred by the cow your parents\rGave you as a boy to teach responsibility.\rAlready you are space immeasurable\rBy your slide rule, your graphs that plotted\rPayload, liftoff, escape velocity.\r          3. Prayer\rIn the house of the dead I pace the halls:\rThe walls, collapsing, stretch away in desert\rOr flatten into horizonless ocean.\rI step outside, the door clicking shut\rComforting in its finality ...\rNow I see the house as if I looked down\rFrom far off mountains, and saw you crouching in\rThe sun-scoured yard, eyes keenly focused,\rPupils narrowing to a cat's green slits:\rI can't look you in the face, you see only\rThe openness of sky rising above mountains.\r(Only after the world had emptied\rYou and filled you with its openness\rWill I feel the love I pray to feel?)\r          4. The God\ra dream A warming pulsing flood like blood surging through\rVeins, and now the god stirs in my hands\rDull as stone in this gravity-less Nowhere.\rSensation shivering through me, deliberate and sure,\rI cradle you, I sponge you clean\rAs if you were my son, the emptiness you\rDrink like heavy black milk erasing\rYour wrinkles and gouged lines of pain.\rThe god bends me to the work, my fingers driven\rBy the god, blinded by the god's\rNeutrality, until I pull apart the threads\rIn this place the god commands:\rFace wholly unwoven, without heart, mind, you\rare nothing in my hands but my hands moving.\r          5. His Stare\rAbsently there in a moment of pure being\rHe sits in his chair, eyes locked, staring:\rThe air's transparence gains solidity\rFrom his looking; while his emaciated features,\rThe way his flesh sags from sharpening cheekbones,\rMake the summer air weigh like marble on the harsh green\rOf the trees he is too weak to prune.\rAnd yet the contemplative distance he is sealed in\rProjects with ferocious purpose the will of his body\rTo withdraw into this eerily removed contemplation\rLike one who has heard a tuning fork ringing\rAnd enters and becomes each spectral vibration;\rSo utterly absorbed that love is a distraction; even\rThe world, its barest colors, bleeding away before that stare.\r          6. The Current\rThe numbing current of the Demorol\rSweeps him out to sea where the secret night\rHe lives in slowly begins to darken,\rHis daytime routine of watching his blood cycle\rThrough the tubes of a machine shadowed by blackness\rBlinding as an underwater cave. Already\rHe filters the dark water through gills aligned\rTo strain that element he more and more resembles:\rLike walls of water held in miraculous\rSuspension, the moment of his death looms impartially\rAbove him, my hands holding his tightening\rIts grip even as his hand loosens ...\rAs if my hand could lead him past that undulating\rWeight towering above us out of sight.\r          7. The Rehearsal\rI lead you back, your Orpheus, until you\rStand inhaling, on the topmost stair,\rThe rank rich air of breathing flesh—\rBut like fumes rising from earth's molten core\rThe voices of the dead reach out to you,\rYour whispering parents, dead for forty years,\rEntreating me to turn—and so I\rTurn, as must you: Your footsteps die,\rYou dwindle, blur into unfillable\rSpace echoing like the dark of a cathedral ...\rBut there is no dark, no stair, no Orpheus\r—Only this voice rehearsing breath\rBy breath in words you'll never read these\rLines stolen from your death.\n	'1':3 '2':117 '3':214 '4':324 '5':438 '6':558 '7':669 'absent':441 'absorb':541 'across':126 'air':130,458,481,689 'align':613 'along':73 'alreadi':48,197,605 'apart':413 'astronaut':139 'away':230,554 'back':34,675 'barest':551 'becom':535 'bed':122 'begin':83,580 'bend':393 'black':381,599 'blast':140 'bleed':553 'blind':404,600 'blood':334,589 'blur':734 'bodi':148,515 'boy':193 'breath':691,758,760 'cat':280 'cathedr':744 'cave':604 'chair':453 'cheekbon':477 'clean':368 'click':243 'collaps':228 'color':552 'comfort':245 'command':421 'contempl':501,522 'core':701 'could':656 'countdown':118 'cow':186 'cradl':363 'crematori':165 'crouch':266 'current':560,563 'cycl':590 'd':77 'dam':37 'dark':22,609,741,749 'darken':582 'daytim':584 'dead':221,706,714 'death':635,772 'deliber':359 'demorol':566 'desert':232 'die':85,731 'distanc':502 'distant':168 'distract':546 'door':242 'dream':328 'drift':176 'drink':378 'driven':400 'drop':112 'dull':346 'dust':182 'dwindl':733 'earth':698 'echo':738 'eerili':520 'element':617 'emaci':468 'empti':307,376 'enter':533 'entreat':718 'eras':383 'escap':212 'even':27,547,647 'everi':110 'eye':143,273,454 'face':128,291,422 'fall':20,99 'far':260 'featur':469 'feel':317,323 'feroci':509 'fever':150 'fight':12 'fill':310 'filter':607 'final':248 'finger':399 'flatten':234 'flesh':473,692 'flood':39,67,332 'focus':275 'follow':107 'footstep':730 'fork':530 'forti':716 'fume':695 'gain':461 'gave':189 'gill':612 'god':326,341,392,403,407,420 'goug':387 'gradual':100 'graph':207 'graviti':352 'gravity-less':351 'green':282,488 'grip':646 'hall':225 'hand':345,433,436,641,650,655 'harsh':487 'hear':80 'heard':527 'heart':426 'heat':156 'heavi':380 'held':627 'helpless':136 'hold':33,642 'horizonless':236 'hospit':121 'hous':218,253 'hurtl':30 'immeasur':201 'imparti':637 'inhal':681 'insid':59 'intens':174 'keen':274 'keep':32 'last':111 'lead':657,673 'less':353 'lie':135 'liftoff':211 'like':35,153,180,333,379,483,523,623,694,739 'line':388,768 'live':577 'll':764 'lock':455 'long':24 'look':257,287,465 'loom':636 'loosen':651 'love':319,543 'lung':133 'machin':596 'make':478 'mani':57 'marbl':484 'marsh':90 'mask':125 'milk':382 'mind':427 'miracul':629 'molten':700 'moment':7,445,632 'mountain':262,301 'move':437 'must':727 'narrow':277 'neutral':409 'never':765 'night':575 'noth':42,430 'nowher':354 'numb':562 'oblivi':144 'ocean':237 'one':61,524 'open':296,314 'orpheus':677,753 'outsid':240 'oven':166 'overtop':40 'pace':223 'pain':10,390 'parent':188,713 'past':659 'payload':210 'phantom':155 'pipe':162 'place':418 'plastic':124 'plot':209 'pour':17,115 'pray':321 'prayer':215 'presenc':151 'project':507 'prune':497 'pull':412 'puls':93,331 'pupil':276 'pure':447 'purpos':510 'rank':687 'reach':707 'read':766 'rehears':671,757 'remov':521 'resembl':622 'respons':196 'rich':688 'ring':531 'rise':299,696 'routin':585 'rule':205 'sag':474 'saw':264 'scour':271 'sea':571 'seal':505 'secret':574 'see':251,293 'seem':171 'sensat':355 'shadow':597 'sharpen':476 'shimmer':152 'shiver':356 'shrill':95 'shut':244 'sight':668 'silenc':104 'siphon':129 'sit':450 'sky':298 'slide':204 'slit':283 'slowli':579 'solid':462 'son':374 'sourc':53 'space':142,200,737 'spectral':537 'speechless':8 'spong':366 'spring':92 'stair':685,751 'stand':680 'stare':179,440,456,557 'step':239 'still':101 'stir':183,342 'stolen':769 'stone':348 'stop':45 'strain':615 'stretch':229 'summer':480 'sun':270 'sun-scour':269 'sundown':98 'sunup':96 'sure':361 'surg':47,335 'suspens':630 'swallow':64 'sweep':567 'swirl':50 'teach':195 'terror':14 'thread':415 'throat':58,62 'tighten':644 'today':4,5 'topmost':684 'tower':663 'trail':159 'transpar':460 'tree':491 'tube':593 'tune':529 'turn':721,725 'unappeas':102 'underwat':603 'undul':661 'unfil':736 'unquench':23 'unstopp':66 'unwoven':424 'us':665 'utter':540 'vein':337 'veloc':213 'vibrat':538 'voic':55,82,703,756 'wall':227,624 'want':78 'warm':330 'watch':587 'water':610,626 'way':88,471 'weak':495 'weigh':482 'weight':662 'whisper':712 'wholli':423 'withdraw':517 'without':425 'word':762 'work':2,397 'world':305,549 'wrinkl':385 'yard':272 'year':717 'yet':499

219	Matins	106		\nI I’ve felt undeserving. I’ve made myself ill with the glory, in the unleavened garden disgorged the lies and scared away with a stick a snake. What made me cover that which I could not have? I’ve grieved and walked in catacombs, I’ve felt undeserving. I’ve made myself ill with the glory. Even the falling leaves gesture their renunciation. I disgorge the lies and abhor the serpent’s hiss. I remember seasons, things I bring from far away, and grieve. I walk in catacombs. In gardens now, by the stone walls, sunlight closes, the falling leaves gesture their renunciation. I remember being in a field touching a man’s body. I remember seasons, things I bring from far away and things that hold their breath for shame. His skin was soft as a girl’s and he closed his eyes. I placed apple petals on his eyelids; we were lying in a field and I touched his body. Then there were clouds, an uncanny silence, as when in a green place the air holds its breath for shame. What made me covet what I could not have? Ill with the power and glory, a thrashing in my chest, I remember the unleavened gardens, petals falling singly, the yellow snake disgorging lies. II I’ve grieved and walked in catacombs. I’ve felt undeserving. I’ve made myself ill with the glory, power and glory-- a thrashing in my rib cage. I’ve gone into the unleavened spring garden, disgorged the lies, and scared away with a stick a snake. I’ve grieved and walked in catacombs. What made me cover that which I could not have? I’ve felt undeserving. In this bright land that changes from yellow to green and back to yellow, I remember seasons, things I bring with me from far away and things that hold their breath as if for shame.

220	Waking	106		\nIt was dusk, the light hesitating and a murmer in the wind, when the deer, exhausted, turned to look at me, an arrow in its side. Though I pity dreamers, taking a thread and weaving it upon the loom of Self—the secret, gaudy, wonderful new cloth—, I will tell the end of the story. His shoulder was torn, the joint held by one sinew, which I severed with the blade of the arrow, so when he ran there were no impediments. The black dogs that followed were swifter, their barking ancient, despicable. As he fell, his chest turned to breastplate, his one powerful arm covered with pagan signs. Nearly stupid in my waiting for what would happen next, each breath propelling me and him toward dust, I woke, the sheets soaked, heart fluttering—: When death comes into the sleeping room as through a tiny hole, like a rent in the Covenant, it hurts.\n	'ancient':93 'arm':106 'arrow':24,75 'bark':92 'black':85 'blade':72 'breastplat':102 'breath':122 'chest':99 'cloth':48 'come':138 'coven':153 'cover':107 'death':137 'deer':16 'despic':94 'dog':86 'dreamer':31 'dusk':4 'dust':128 'end':53 'exhaust':17 'fell':97 'flutter':135 'follow':88 'gaudi':45 'happen':119 'heart':134 'held':63 'hesit':7 'hole':147 'hurt':155 'impedi':83 'joint':62 'light':6 'like':148 'look':20 'loom':40 'murmer':10 'near':111 'new':47 'next':120 'one':65,104 'pagan':109 'piti':30 'power':105 'propel':123 'ran':79 'rent':150 'room':142 'secret':44 'self':42 'sever':69 'sheet':132 'shoulder':58 'side':27 'sign':110 'sinew':66 'sleep':141 'soak':133 'stori':56 'stupid':112 'swifter':90 'take':32 'tell':51 'though':28 'thread':34 'tini':146 'torn':60 'toward':127 'turn':18,100 'upon':38 'wait':115 'wake':1 'weav':36 'wind':13 'woke':130 'wonder':46 'would':118
221	All Summer Long	106		\nThe dogs eat hoof slivers and lie under the porch. A strand of human hair hangs strangely from a fruit tree like a cry in the throat. The sky is clay for the child who is past being tired, who wanders in waist-deep grasses. Gnats rise in a vapor, in a long mounting whine around her forehead and ears. The sun is an indistinct moon. Frail sticks of grass poke her ankles, and a wet froth of spiders touches her legs like wet fingers. The musk and smell of air are as hot as the savory terrible exhales from a tired horse. The parents are sleeping all afternoon, and no one explains the long uneasy afternoons. She hears their combined breathing and swallowing salivas, and sees their sides rising and falling like the sides of horses in the hot pasture. At evening a breeze dries and crumbles the sky and the clouds float like undershirts and cotton dresses on a clothesline. Horses rock to their feet and race or graze. Parents open their shutters and call the lonely, happy child home. The child who hates silences talks and talks of cicadas and the manes of horses.\n	'afternoon':113,121 'air':95 'ankl':77 'around':60 'breath':126 'breez':149 'call':181 'child':37,185,188 'cicada':196 'clay':34 'clotheslin':166 'cloud':157 'combin':125 'cotton':162 'cri':27 'crumbl':152 'deep':48 'dog':5 'dress':163 'dri':150 'ear':64 'eat':6 'even':147 'exhal':103 'explain':117 'fall':136 'feet':171 'finger':89 'float':158 'forehead':62 'frail':71 'froth':81 'fruit':23 'gnat':50 'grass':49,74 'graze':175 'hair':18 'hang':19 'happi':184 'hate':190 'hear':123 'home':186 'hoof':7 'hors':107,141,167,201 'hot':98,144 'human':17 'indistinct':69 'leg':86 'lie':10 'like':25,87,137,159 'lone':183 'long':3,57,119 'mane':199 'moon':70 'mount':58 'musk':91 'one':116 'open':177 'parent':109,176 'past':40 'pastur':145 'poke':75 'porch':13 'race':173 'rise':51,134 'rock':168 'saliva':129 'savori':101 'see':131 'shutter':179 'side':133,139 'silenc':191 'sky':32,154 'sleep':111 'sliver':8 'smell':93 'spider':83 'stick':72 'strand':15 'strang':20 'summer':2 'sun':66 'swallow':128 'talk':192,194 'terribl':102 'throat':30 'tire':42,106 'touch':84 'tree':24 'undershirt':160 'uneasi':120 'vapor':54 'waist':47 'waist-deep':46 'wander':44 'wet':80,88 'whine':59
222	The Fearful Child	106		\nAs a child I parleyed with animals, stuffed and real. Making my kitten pilot of a boot, I guided from one end of a string the dizzy flight and collapse. I was fearful of people as well as things, and my faithful toy shepherd with his painted face sat by me on the bed in the gloom. I was disdainful of dolls as weak people. In the favorite story I told myself my parents were made over into fair-limbed, brave angels who smiled into their god’s eyes when summoned. I was benevolent, afraid to let go of this image at night because I couldn’t hide deep enough under the covers to be overlooked by death, the angel bending over me who had been wronged. I read histories of queens, regal and barbarian, whose leopard’s eyes restrained man or wild beast. I rambled along tidal rivers and in the marshes where the green-golden grasses dazzled the sun, and felt the ache of sea-air in my lungs. I saw water spume near Atlantic cliffs. I examined lichen. I saw great light drown darkness. Then at thirteen I lay in the bleak bed before sleep and heard the pleadings and the murderous kisses; and burned, like a bear his fat, my soul. I quaked at the sound of my voice whispering, No, or turned my face to the wall and wept salt onto my knuckles. In the serene light of sun-up, before sparrows tumbled up from the earth, whispering and singing, and the exquisite sea and sky mobilized their heavy, blue currents, I was consoled. I walked through beauty without knowing why and told no one, wanting nothing else to touch me and never to move anyone in any way. I hid away from the house and learned the dark was not a dream but could show the pale gravel of a real driveway. I saw for the first time later the new moon and the full moon in one piece. I no longer feared the night, night like a bear at ease in his wide habitat. In the greatness of such space I said, This is me.\n	'ach':170 'afraid':99 'air':174 'along':151 'angel':86,124 'anim':10 'anyon':298 'atlant':183 'away':304 'barbarian':139 'bear':217,352 'beast':148 'beauti':280 'bed':57,202 'bend':125 'benevol':98 'bleak':201 'blue':272 'boot':20 'brave':85 'burn':214 'child':3,6 'cliff':184 'collaps':33 'consol':276 'could':317 'couldn':110 'cover':117 'current':273 'dark':193,311 'dazzl':164 'death':122 'deep':113 'disdain':63 'dizzi':30 'doll':65 'dream':315 'driveway':325 'drown':192 'earth':259 'eas':354 'els':290 'end':25 'enough':114 'examin':186 'exquisit':265 'eye':93,143 'face':51,235 'fair':83 'fair-limb':82 'faith':45 'fat':219 'favorit':71 'fear':2,36,346 'felt':168 'first':330 'flight':31 'full':338 'gloom':60 'go':102 'god':91 'golden':162 'grass':163 'gravel':321 'great':190,361 'green':161 'green-golden':160 'guid':22 'habitat':358 'heard':206 'heavi':271 'hid':303 'hide':112 'histori':134 'hous':307 'imag':105 'kiss':212 'kitten':16 'know':282 'knuckl':244 'later':332 'lay':198 'learn':309 'leopard':141 'let':101 'lichen':187 'light':191,248 'like':215,350 'limb':84 'longer':345 'lung':177 'made':79 'make':14 'man':145 'marsh':157 'mobil':269 'moon':335,339 'move':297 'murder':211 'near':182 'never':295 'new':334 'night':107,348,349 'noth':289 'one':24,287,341 'onto':242 'overlook':120 'paint':50 'pale':320 'parent':77 'parley':8 'peopl':38,68 'piec':342 'pilot':17 'plead':208 'quak':223 'queen':136 'rambl':150 'read':133 'real':13,324 'regal':137 'restrain':144 'river':153 'said':366 'salt':241 'sat':52 'saw':179,189,327 'sea':173,266 'sea-air':172 'seren':247 'shepherd':47 'show':318 'sing':262 'sky':268 'sleep':204 'smile':88 'soul':221 'sound':226 'space':364 'sparrow':254 'spume':181 'stori':72 'string':28 'stuf':11 'summon':95 'sun':166,251 'sun-up':250 'thing':42 'thirteen':196 'tidal':152 'time':331 'told':74,285 'touch':292 'toy':46 'tumbl':255 'turn':233 'voic':229 'walk':278 'wall':238 'want':288 'water':180 'way':301 'weak':67 'well':40 'wept':240 'whisper':230,260 'whose':140 'wide':357 'wild':147 'without':281 'wrong':131
223	To Kill a Deer	106		\nInto the changes of autumn brush the doe walked, and the hide, head, and ears were the tinsel browns. They made her. I could not see her. She reappeared, stuffed with apples, and I shot her. Into the pines she ran, and I ran after. I might have lost her, seeing no sign of blood or scuffle, but felt myself part of the woods, a woman with a doe’s ears, and heard her dying, counted her last breaths like a song of dying, and found her dying. I shot her again because her lungs rattled like castanets, then poked her with the gun barrel because her eyes were dusty and unreal. I opened her belly and pushed the insides like rotted fruit into a rabbit hole, skinned her, broke her leg joints under my knee, took the meat, smelled the half-digested smell that was herself. Ah, I closed her eyes. I left her refolded in some briars with the last sun on her head like a benediction, head tilted on its axis of neck and barren bone; head bent wordless over a death, though I heard the night wind blowing through her fur, heard riot in the emptied head.\n	'ah':153 'appl':36 'autumn':9 'axi':179 'barrel':109 'barren':183 'belli':120 'benedict':174 'bent':186 'blood':59 'blow':197 'bone':184 'breath':83 'briar':164 'broke':134 'brown':23 'brush':10 'castanet':102 'chang':7 'close':155 'could':28 'count':80 'death':190 'deer':4 'die':79,88,92 'digest':148 'doe':12,73 'dusti':114 'ear':19,75 'empti':205 'eye':112,157 'felt':63 'found':90 'fruit':127 'fur':200 'gun':108 'half':147 'half-digest':146 'head':17,171,175,185,206 'heard':77,193,201 'hide':16 'hole':131 'insid':124 'joint':137 'kill':2 'knee':140 'last':82,167 'left':159 'leg':136 'like':84,101,125,172 'lost':53 'lung':99 'made':25 'meat':143 'might':51 'neck':181 'night':195 'open':118 'part':65 'pine':43 'poke':104 'push':122 'rabbit':130 'ran':45,48 'rattl':100 'reappear':33 'refold':161 'riot':202 'rot':126 'scuffl':61 'see':30,55 'shot':39,94 'sign':57 'skin':132 'smell':144,149 'song':86 'stuf':34 'sun':168 'though':191 'tilt':176 'tinsel':22 'took':141 'unreal':116 'walk':13 'wind':196 'woman':70 'wood':68 'wordless':187
224	Anasazi, Ancient Enemies	107		\nI rubbed wax crayon against blowing paper. From the rock face footed a dancer white through red.     My family gave me over     to it, gone for the river. Were I a peasant harvesting grapes near Beaune in the last century, even, I might have dreamed     a saint lifting off for Arles,     Les Saintes Maries de la Mer, and knowing about cannon in that long peace, might have been troubled therefore that my flier     hauled a magnum of the best     and bloodied the west sky with it and vanished. My fisting that loose sheet in place was secretarial, not visionary!     Already in that decade     small tribes entered the void like windows on a skyscraper when the bent janitor makes his way. But those flick back on     each night, costly difference.     It is not only portents in dream or flapping images of the gone or the soon-to-be-going or the tremblingly poised     that catch like undertow     the foot in tide-rip toeing down the singing or remembered beach. We study populations in the forests,     we hold the paper flat,     mark, note, warn—the dictated prophecies do their work, we do some work— cut horn from rhinos so they won’t be poached.     But, to go on from there,     one needs to stand in the doorway some evening and feel the air as if it were fire pulling illusionlessly, letting the draw     of one fact heat its chain     of links, such as, Japan clear-cutting forests in Siberia where tigers not already harvested     lope their dwindling range,     two hundred as the hinge for their growled arc of existence, bones of the others ground to powders for old men’s potencies.     One needs to feel the tug     of the draft on skin, the drag of process utterly anciently itself. Faster, now, the pull is from birth through dwelling through     dissolution, along lines     streaming through us, ageless winds.\n	'ageless':320 'air':226 'along':315 'alreadi':103,257 'anasazi':1 'ancient':2,302 'arc':271 'arl':54 'back':127 'beach':173 'beaun':39 'bent':119 'best':82 'birth':310 'bloodi':84 'blow':9 'bone':274 'cannon':64 'catch':158 'centuri':43 'chain':242 'clear':249 'clear-cut':248 'cost':131 'crayon':7 'cut':198,250 'dancer':17 'de':58 'decad':106 'dictat':189 'differ':132 'dissolut':314 'doorway':220 'draft':294 'drag':298 'draw':236 'dream':48,139 'dwell':312 'dwindl':261 'enemi':3 'enter':109 'even':44,222 'exist':273 'face':14 'fact':239 'famili':22 'faster':304 'feel':224,289 'fire':231 'fist':93 'flap':141 'flat':184 'flick':126 'flier':76 'foot':15,162 'forest':179,251 'gave':23 'go':152,210 'gone':28,145 'grape':37 'ground':278 'growl':270 'harvest':36,258 'haul':77 'heat':240 'hing':267 'hold':181 'horn':199 'hundr':264 'illusionless':233 'imag':142 'janitor':120 'japan':247 'know':62 'la':59 'last':42 'les':55 'let':234 'lift':51 'like':112,159 'line':316 'link':244 'long':67 'loos':95 'lope':259 'magnum':79 'make':121 'mari':57 'mark':185 'men':283 'mer':60 'might':46,69 'near':38 'need':215,287 'night':130 'note':186 'old':282 'one':214,238,286 'other':277 'paper':10,183 'peac':68 'peasant':35 'place':98 'poach':207 'pois':156 'popul':176 'portent':137 'potenc':285 'powder':280 'process':300 'propheci':190 'pull':232,307 'rang':262 'red':20 'rememb':172 'rhino':201 'rip':166 'river':31 'rock':13 'rub':5 'saint':50,56 'secretari':100 'sheet':96 'siberia':253 'sing':170 'skin':296 'sky':87 'skyscrap':116 'small':107 'soon':149 'soon-to-be-go':148 'stand':217 'stream':317 'studi':175 'therefor':73 'tide':165 'tide-rip':164 'tiger':255 'toe':167 'trembl':155 'tribe':108 'troubl':72 'tug':291 'two':263 'undertow':160 'us':319 'utter':301 'vanish':91 'visionari':102 'void':111 'warn':187 'wax':6 'way':123 'west':86 'white':18 'wind':321 'window':113 'won':204 'work':193,197
225	Little Fugue	107		\nAn apple paring curled from the knife wetly     down my thumb— and what I had failed to do rightly touching that life     next to mine, wearing late afternoon’s numb luminosity, impaled me.     A hunter knee-deep in salt marsh, whom Anton Chekov might have set there and then left,     back to doctoring, or choked off as too dark, wanton,     met the steep flailing of teal, trailed their shrill lift, but stood only, hearing them.     Pouring the last tea of an evening, dark amber alive, breathing in quintessence     of India, I felt limber bark sheathing the shrub of my life’s tree with root good, but dense, dark, local, raw there,     and so in dark woke, the seeing doctor, two simple profiles of linked characters     in his air, cruel, good, a pair ample, true across that split yoke, true to its splayed force— simple so rare, though.\n	'across':138 'afternoon':30 'air':131 'aliv':88 'amber':87 'ampl':136 'anton':45 'appl':4 'back':54 'bark':97 'breath':89 'charact':128 'chekov':46 'choke':58 'cruel':132 'curl':6 'dark':62,86,111,118 'deep':40 'dens':110 'doctor':56,122 'even':85 'fail':18 'felt':95 'flail':67 'forc':146 'fugu':2 'good':108,133 'hear':77 'hunter':37 'impal':34 'india':93 'knee':39 'knee-deep':38 'knife':9 'last':81 'late':29 'left':53 'life':24,103 'lift':73 'limber':96 'link':127 'littl':1 'local':112 'luminos':33 'marsh':43 'met':64 'might':47 'mine':27 'next':25 'numb':32 'pair':135 'pare':5 'pour':79 'profil':125 'quintess':91 'rare':149 'raw':113 'right':21 'root':107 'salt':42 'see':121 'set':49 'sheath':98 'shrill':72 'shrub':100 'simpl':124,147 'splay':145 'split':140 'steep':66 'stood':75 'tea':82 'teal':69 'though':150 'thumb':13 'touch':22 'trail':70 'tree':105 'true':137,142 'two':123 'wanton':63 'wear':28 'wet':10 'woke':119 'yoke':141

227	From the Headland at Cumae	107		\nFaded and baked here to a tawny grit, spills of blood and seed from humanity called from it for its crimes against mute earth gully in footpaths, dribble down to the sea, payment now and forever drawn from birth through flesh’s sunny darkness. Light yeasts in it. And if I find the slope to crumbled temples of that light’s god dragging at me through heat, shallow degrees of slant up to remnant stone, then something more than burnt air, or the repeat of weight known as time, pulls heavily in this zone, something the bone brings, terrible through simple. Phoibos, slayer at distances with shock, sower of plague and arrower of healing, tension of bright-dark beyond spanning, love will not quite cast out evil while revealing your fissionables. The raven was your dove. Heavy isotopes hum with crickets in rock. Neither woman nor man, my driver laughed when his lights torched writhings down the far shoulder, cross-dresser in the night beyond Naples, huge, sinuous, crooning as we shot past. Life seems older in its variant forms, drawn by the centrifuge to the rim and swinging, swayed in time’s dream uncalfed. For the vast thrower, shafter of quivering force, sex was filigree in whoever served. Pythoness, yes, wombed keeper of those coils in the wet cellar where tongue darted and swerved. But her own throat when it swelled with voice knew toils past a man’s strength, torqued bulging from the source. And that young man fitted with bone and thong and membrane from his withers by his father the maze molder, when he climbed into flame itself in the high nucleus, dripped as slather down the sky’s maw. Union there, with an aim at the center, crisped on a central soundless gong, sizzling from his overreach extended back on itself and down, the soundless hurry of the sea far below minutely riven, trembling in place, diamonds in blue slurry nowhere disturbed yet flecking everywhere, driven— all this boy’s cry endlessly thin, suspended. The sybil when at last her throat disgorged its burdens rumbled like a pawing bull, or the bull-fiend on Krete, and shrilly warbled. Birds ride the bull’s hump in stone graphs, that full barbarity at poise piercing now the garbled clang of Ikaros, over us tensile and forged. This is the crumbling whistle of shells and frags in their close arc. Philosophy gets precise when it turns practical. This in our background whir. Archimedes, old Fermi in your eyes, naked, ecstatic with theorems that assure conclusion, your city falls, your hacked flesh sags. There was a sprig which, if you bore it in hand on landing here, your pilot drowned and your herald crushed in the surf, would bend and seem to listen— there was a branch that trailed her voice through imperiled corridors to throats of the dead, and glistened, then brought you back to your breath near shining sand. And there was pelt from the solar scavenger, its blond mane tossing with your workings, turning catastrophe to triumph, lion crud strewn now on waves, coat of the charger burning obsidian cobalt platinum and mud in craters of the shaker and avenger. Eroded skull of this squat promontory, nubbled shrine over cave by surf hypnotized before deeps enameled with fire’s mosaic, you are the structure lucid though pulverized behind the logics, and the omens prosaic in their spelling out, and the blaze of story. Give me your light! I am the darkened thing seeking it. Give me your fire and your cry! But hood me from sulfurs she inhaled when she twisted over the fissure, give me your hand from the sky we have fallen into. Give, yes, what you insisted she utter, rasped uncoilings of your spring! And then release me to the animal shy of speech yet steady in ecstasies, your cousin the outsider’s gaze through life, the drink of it down, and finally mind as frieze eternally in metamorphic strife released, sea stone and cloud infinitely small. And there the migrant and his wanderers may find the new land, and their future wars may roll, exhausted in hissing foam, to sink over the fish spines, and the blunderers of fulfillment stare at samsaric wink of ocean, stare and find sleep that dissolves the curse.\n	'aim':296 'air':86 'anim':646 'arc':410 'archimed':423 'arrow':117 'assur':434 'aveng':542 'back':311,494 'background':421 'bake':8 'barbar':383 'behind':570 'bend':468 'beyond':125,172 'bird':372 'birth':44 'blaze':583 'blond':510 'blood':16 'blue':331 'blunder':713 'bone':102,260 'bore':450 'boy':341 'branch':476 'breath':497 'bright':123 'bright-dark':122 'bring':103 'brought':492 'bulg':250 'bull':361,365,375 'bull-fiend':364 'burden':356 'burn':530 'burnt':85 'call':21 'cast':131 'catastroph':517 'cave':552 'cellar':227 'center':299 'central':303 'centrifug':191 'charger':529 'citi':437 'clang':390 'climb':276 'close':409 'cloud':680 'coat':526 'cobalt':532 'coil':223 'conclus':435 'corridor':483 'cousin':655 'crater':537 'cri':343,603 'cricket':147 'crime':26 'crisp':300 'croon':176 'cross':167 'cross-dress':166 'crud':521 'crumbl':61,401 'crush':463 'cuma':5 'curs':729 'dark':49,124 'darken':593 'dart':230 'dead':488 'deep':557 'degre':74 'diamond':329 'disgorg':354 'dissolv':727 'distanc':110 'disturb':334 'dove':142 'drag':68 'drawn':42,188 'dream':201 'dresser':168 'dribbl':33 'drink':663 'drip':284 'driven':338 'driver':155 'drown':459 'earth':29 'ecstasi':653 'ecstat':430 'enamel':558 'endless':344 'erod':543 'etern':672 'everywher':337 'evil':133 'exhaust':701 'extend':310 'eye':428 'fade':6 'fall':438 'fallen':626 'far':164,322 'father':270 'fermi':425 'fiend':366 'filigre':213 'final':668 'find':57,691,724 'fire':560,600 'fish':709 'fission':137 'fissur':616 'fit':258 'flame':278 'fleck':336 'flesh':46,441 'foam':704 'footpath':32 'forc':210 'forev':41 'forg':397 'form':187 'frag':406 'friez':671 'fulfil':715 'full':382 'futur':697 'garbl':389 'gaze':659 'get':412 'give':586,597,617,628 'glisten':490 'god':67 'gong':305 'graph':380 'grit':13 'gulli':30 'hack':440 'hand':453,620 'headland':3 'heal':119 'heat':72 'heavi':143 'heavili':96 'herald':462 'high':282 'hiss':703 'hood':605 'huge':174 'hum':145 'human':20 'hump':377 'hurri':318 'hypnot':555 'ikaro':392 'imperil':482 'infinit':681 'inhal':610 'insist':632 'isotop':144 'keeper':220 'knew':242 'known':92 'krete':368 'land':455,694 'last':351 'laugh':156 'life':181,661 'light':50,65,159,589 'like':358 'lion':520 'listen':472 'logic':572 'love':127 'lucid':567 'man':153,246,257 'mane':511 'maw':291 'may':690,699 'maze':272 'membran':264 'metamorph':674 'migrant':686 'mind':669 'minut':324 'molder':273 'mosaic':562 'mud':535 'mute':28 'nake':429 'napl':173 'near':498 'neither':150 'new':693 'night':171 'nowher':333 'nubbl':549 'nucleus':283 'obsidian':531 'ocean':721 'old':424 'older':183 'omen':575 'outsid':657 'overreach':309 'past':180,244 'paw':360 'payment':38 'pelt':504 'philosophi':411 'phoibo':107 'pierc':386 'pilot':458 'place':328 'plagu':115 'platinum':533 'pois':385 'practic':417 'precis':413 'promontori':548 'prosaic':576 'pull':95 'pulver':569 'pytho':217 'quit':130 'quiver':209 'rasp':635 'raven':139 'releas':642,676 'remnant':79 'repeat':89 'reveal':135 'ride':373 'rim':194 'riven':325 'rock':149 'roll':700 'rumbl':357 'sag':442 'samsar':718 'sand':500 'scaveng':508 'sea':37,321,677 'seed':18 'seek':595 'seem':182,470 'serv':216 'sex':211 'shafter':207 'shaker':540 'shallow':73 'shell':404 'shi':647 'shine':499 'shock':112 'shot':179 'shoulder':165 'shrilli':370 'shrine':550 'simpl':106 'sink':706 'sinuous':175 'sizzl':306 'skull':544 'sky':289,623 'slant':76 'slather':286 'slayer':108 'sleep':725 'slope':59 'slurri':332 'small':682 'solar':507 'someth':82,100 'soundless':304,317 'sourc':253 'sower':113 'span':126 'speech':649 'spell':579 'spill':14 'spine':710 'sprig':446 'spring':639 'squat':547 'stare':716,722 'steadi':651 'stone':80,379,678 'stori':585 'strength':248 'strewn':522 'strife':675 'structur':566 'sulfur':608 'sunni':48 'surf':466,554 'suspend':346 'sway':197 'swell':239 'swerv':232 'swing':196 'sybil':348 'tawni':12 'templ':62 'tensil':395 'tension':120 'terribl':104 'theorem':432 'thin':345 'thing':594 'thong':262 'though':568 'throat':236,353,485 'thrower':206 'time':94,199 'toil':243 'tongu':229 'torch':160 'torqu':249 'toss':512 'trail':478 'trembl':326 'triumph':519 'turn':416,516 'twist':613 'uncalf':202 'uncoil':636 'union':292 'us':394 'utter':634 'variant':186 'vast':205 'voic':241,480 'wander':689 'war':698 'warbl':371 'wave':525 'weight':91 'wet':226 'whir':422 'whistl':402 'whoever':215 'wink':719 'wither':267 'woman':151 'womb':219 'work':515 'would':467 'writh':161 'yeast':51 'yes':218,629 'yet':335,650 'young':256 'zone':99
228	Safe	108		\nYou used to be able to flag a ride in this country.  Impossible now—everyone is afraid    of strangers.   Well, there was fear then too,  and it was mutual: drivers versus hitchhikers.  And we rode without seat belts,  insurance or beliefs.  People  would see me far ahead on a hill like a seedling,  watch me grow in the windshield  and not know they were going to stop until  they got right up to me.  Maybe they wanted  company or thought I’d give them  some excitement.  It was the age  of impulse, of lonesome knee jerks.  An old woman  stopped, blew smoke in my face  and after I was already in her car she asked me  if I wanted a ride.  I’m telling you.  Late one night a construction boss pulled over.  One of his crew had been hit  by the mob, he said as he drove, distraught  and needing to talk to someone.  We rode around for a long time.  He said, I never wore a gun to a funeral before,  but they’ve gotta be after me too.  Then he looked at me and patted the bulge  in his coat.  Don’t worry, he said, you’re safe.\n	'abl':6 'afraid':18 'age':91 'ahead':48 'alreadi':111 'around':159 'ask':116 'belief':42 'belt':39 'blew':102 'boss':132 'bulg':191 'car':114 'coat':194 'compani':79 'construct':131 'countri':13 'crew':138 'd':83 'distraught':150 'driver':31 'drove':149 'everyon':16 'excit':87 'face':106 'far':47 'fear':24 'flag':8 'funer':173 'give':84 'go':66 'got':71 'gotta':178 'grow':57 'gun':170 'hill':51 'hit':141 'hitchhik':33 'imposs':14 'impuls':93 'insur':40 'jerk':97 'knee':96 'know':63 'late':127 'like':52 'lonesom':95 'long':162 'look':185 'm':124 'mayb':76 'mob':144 'mutual':30 'need':152 'never':167 'night':129 'old':99 'one':128,135 'pat':189 'peopl':43 'pull':133 're':201 'ride':10,122 'right':72 'rode':36,158 'safe':1,202 'said':146,165,199 'seat':38 'see':45 'seedl':54 'smoke':103 'someon':156 'stop':68,101 'stranger':20 'talk':154 'tell':125 'thought':81 'time':163 'use':3 've':177 'versus':32 'want':78,120 'watch':55 'well':21 'windshield':60 'without':37 'woman':100 'wore':168 'worri':197 'would':44
229	The Difficulty with a Tree	109		\nA woman was fighting a tree. The tree had come to rage at the woman’s attack, breaking free from its earth it waddled at her with its great root feet.          Goddamn these sentiencies, roared the tree with birds shrieking in its branches.          Look out, you’ll fall on me, you bastard, screamed the woman as she hit at the tree.          The tree whisked and whisked with its leafy branches.          The woman kicked and bit screaming, kill me kill me or I’ll kill you!          Her husband seeing the commotion came running crying, what tree has lost patience?          The ax the ax, damnfool, the ax, she screamed.          Oh no, roared the tree dragging its long roots rhythmically limping like a sea lion towards her husband.          But oughtn’t we to talk about this? cried her husband.          But oughtn’t we to talk about this, mimicked his wife.          But what is this all about? he cried.          When you see me killing something you should reason that it will want to kill me back, she screamed.          But before her husband could decide what next action to perform the tree had killed both the wife and her husband.          Before the woman died she screamed, now do you see?          He said, what...?

Will you permit me the unparalleled pleasure of taking your clothes off?          I feel that if I should have my penis in your vagina I should have your love; for you do not receive the wretched hardness of my desire into the sweet body of yourself without that you have not come to love me for reasons, if love has reasons, I cannot tell....          Your admirer\n	'admir':213 'bird':37 'bodi':97,134,191 'breast':112 'built':20 'cannot':210 'cloth':158 'color':87 'come':199 'cours':22 'curious':109,113,126 'dear':4 'desir':187 'discourag':66 'enjoy':16 'exist':30 'fact':25 'feel':161 'firm':74 'first':6 'flight':64 'form':40 'front':145 'give':78,98 'hand':131 'hard':184 'horizont':75 'hungri':114 'imagin':56,90 'imaginari':18 'inher':70 'interest':137 'land':80 'letter':3 'line':85 'littl':82 'love':2,176,201,206 'men':51,77 'mind':140 'miss':5 'model':104 'must':48,107 'natur':32 'nonhuman':42 'occur':43 'paper':83 'peni':168 'permit':150 'pleasur':154 'possibl':19,28,71 'postur':46,60 'reason':204,208 'receiv':181 'say':12 'see':119 'seen':35 'surfac':94 'sweet':190 'take':156 'tast':123 'tell':211 'touch':121 'undress':132,143 'univers':101 'unparallel':153 'vagina':171 'vast':79 'want':10 'without':194 'women':53 'word':117 'wretch':183 'yet':105
231	The Adventures of a Turtle	109		\nThe turtle carries his house on his back. He is both the house and the person of that house.          But actually, under the shell is a little room where the true turtle, wearing long underwear, sits at a little table. At one end of the room a series of levers sticks out of slots in the floor, like the controls of a steam shovel. It is with these that the turtle controls the legs of his house.          Most of the time the turtle sits under the sloping ceiling of his turtle room reading catalogues at the little table where a candle burns. He leans on one elbow, and then the other. He crosses one leg, and then the other. Finally he yawns and buries his head in his arms and sleeps.          If he feels a child picking up his house he quickly douses the candle and runs to the control levers and activates the legs of his house and tries to escape.          If he cannot escape he retracts the legs and withdraws the so-called head and waits. He knows that children are careless, and that there will come a time when he will be free to move his house to some secluded place, where he will relight his candle, take out his catalogues and read until at last he yawns. Then he’ll bury his head in his arms and sleep....That is, until another child picks up his house....\n	'activ':158 'actual':26 'adventur':2 'anoth':242 'arm':134,236 'back':13 'buri':129,231 'burn':107 'call':181 'candl':106,150,216 'cannot':170 'careless':190 'carri':8 'catalogu':99,220 'ceil':93 'child':141,243 'children':188 'come':195 'control':65,77,155 'cross':118 'dous':148 'elbow':112 'end':48 'escap':167,171 'feel':139 'final':125 'floor':62 'free':202 'head':131,182,233 'hous':10,18,24,82,145,163,206,247 'know':186 'last':225 'lean':109 'leg':79,120,160,175 'lever':55,156 'like':63 'littl':32,44,102 'll':230 'long':39 'move':204 'one':47,111,119 'person':21 'pick':142,244 'place':210 'quick':147 'read':98,222 'relight':214 'retract':173 'room':33,51,97 'run':152 'seclud':209 'seri':53 'shell':29 'shovel':69 'sit':41,89 'sleep':136,238 'slope':92 'slot':59 'so-cal':179 'steam':68 'stick':56 'tabl':45,103 'take':217 'time':86,197 'tri':165 'true':36 'turtl':5,7,37,76,88,96 'underwear':40 'wait':184 'wear':38 'withdraw':177 'yawn':127,227
232	The Fight in the Meadow	109		\nThe curtains part: it is a summer’s day. There a cow on a grassy slope watches as a bull charges an old aeroplane in a meadow. The bull is punching holes with its horns in the aeroplane’s fabric...          Suddenly the aeroplane’s engine ignites; the meadow is dark blue smoke...          The aeroplane shifts round and faces the charging bull.          As the bull comes in the propeller takes off the end of its muzzle. The bloody nostrils, a ring through them, are flung to the grass with a shattered blossom of teeth.          The bull, blood oozing from the stump of its face, backs off, and charges again. This time the propeller catches the bull behind its lower jaw and flings the head into a tree.          The headless bull backs off once more, and then charges down again. The propeller beating at the headless bull, cutting the body away in a great halo of blood, until only the back legs are standing. These run widely away through the meadow in figure eights and zigzags, until at last they find the aeroplane again. And as they come running down the propeller whacks them apart.          The legs, one with the tail still attached to it, the other somehow retaining both rectum and testicles, scamper off in opposite directions.          The aeroplane turns away; the engine stops.          The shadows are suddenly seen in lengthened form.          The watching cow begins to low ...\n	'aeroplan':29,43,48,59,186,223 'apart':198 'attach':206 'away':154,171,225 'back':109,135,164 'beat':146 'begin':240 'behind':121 'blood':101,160 'bloodi':82 'blossom':96 'blue':56 'bodi':153 'bull':25,34,66,69,100,120,134,150 'catch':118 'charg':26,65,112,141 'come':70,191 'cow':17,239 'curtain':7 'cut':151 'dark':55 'day':14 'direct':221 'eight':177 'end':77 'engin':50,227 'fabric':45 'face':63,108 'fight':2 'figur':176 'find':184 'fling':126 'flung':89 'form':236 'grass':92 'grassi':20 'great':157 'halo':158 'head':128 'headless':133,149 'hole':37 'horn':40 'ignit':51 'jaw':124 'last':182 'leg':165,200 'lengthen':235 'low':242 'lower':123 'meadow':5,32,53,174 'muzzl':80 'nostril':83 'old':28 'one':201 'ooz':102 'opposit':220 'part':8 'propel':73,117,145,195 'punch':36 'rectum':214 'retain':212 'ring':85 'round':61 'run':169,192 'scamper':217 'seen':233 'shadow':230 'shatter':95 'shift':60 'slope':21 'smoke':57 'somehow':211 'stand':167 'still':205 'stop':228 'stump':105 'sudden':46,232 'summer':12 'tail':204 'take':74 'teeth':98 'testicl':216 'time':115 'tree':131 'turn':224 'watch':22,238 'whack':196 'wide':170 'zigzag':179

237	Nights on Planet Earth	111		\n1\rGravel paths on hillsides amid moon-drawn vineyards,\rclick of pearls upon a polished nightstand \rsoft as rainwater, self-minded stars, oboe music \rdistant as the grinding of icebergs against the hull\rof the self and the soul in the darkness \rchanting to the ecstatic chance of existence.\rDeep is the water and long is the moonlight \rinscribing addresses in quicksilver ink,\rbuilding the staircase a lover forever pauses upon.\rDeep is the darkness and long is the night,\rsolid the water and liquid the light. How strange \rthat they arrive at all, nights on planet earth. \r2\rSometimes, not often but repeatedly, the past invades my dreams in the form of a familiar neighborhood I can no longer locate, \ra warren of streets lined with dark cafés and unforgettable bars, a place where I can sing by heart every song on every jukebox,\ra city that feels the way the skin of an octopus looks pulse-changing from color to color, laminar and fluid and electric,\ra city of shadow-draped churches, of busses on dim avenues, or riverlights, or canyonlands, but always a city, and wonderful, and lost.\rSometimes it resembles Amsterdam, students from the ballet school like fanciful gazelles shooting pool in pink tights and soft, shapeless sweaters,\ror Madrid at 4AM, arguing the 18th Brumaire with angry Marxists, or Manhattan when the snowfall crowns every trash-can king of its Bowery stoop,\ror Chicago, or Dublin, or some ideal city of the imagination, as in a movie you can neither remember entirely nor completely forget, \rbarracuda-faced men drinking sake like yakuza in a Harukami novel, women sipping champagne or arrack, the rattle of beaded curtains in the back,\rthe necklaces of Christmas lights reflected in raindrops on windows, the taste of peanuts and their shells crushed to powder underfoot, \ralways real, always elusive, always a city, and wonderful, and lost. All night I wander alone, searching in vain for the irretrievable.\r3\rIn the night I will drink from a cup of ashes and yellow paint.\rIn the night I will gossip with the clouds and grow strong.\rIn the night I will cross rooftops to watch the sea tremble in a dream.\rIn the night I will assemble my army of golden carpenter ants.\rIn the night I will walk the towpath among satellites and cosmic dust.\rIn the night I will cry to the roots of potted plants in empty offices.\rIn the night I will gather the feathers of pigeons in a honey jar.\rIn the night I will become an infant before your flag.\n	'1':5 '18th':227 '2':105 '3':338 '4am':224 'address':66 'alon':331 'alway':193,316,318,320 'amid':10 'among':400 'amsterdam':203 'angri':230 'ant':391 'argu':225 'armi':387 'arrack':286 'arriv':98 'ash':349 'assembl':385 'avenu':187 'back':294 'ballet':207 'bar':138 'barracuda':271 'barracuda-fac':270 'bead':290 'becom':439 'boweri':245 'brumair':228 'build':70 'buss':184 'café':135 'canyonland':191 'carpent':390 'champagn':284 'chanc':53 'chang':166 'chant':49 'chicago':248 'christma':298 'church':182 'citi':153,177,195,254,322 'click':15 'cloud':361 'color':168,170 'complet':268 'cosmic':403 'cri':410 'cross':370 'crown':237 'crush':312 'cup':347 'curtain':291 'dark':48,81,134 'deep':56,78 'dim':186 'distant':31 'drape':181 'drawn':13 'dream':115,379 'drink':274,344 'dublin':250 'dust':404 'earth':4,104 'ecstat':52 'electr':175 'elus':319 'empti':418 'entir':266 'everi':147,150,238 'exist':55 'face':272 'familiar':121 'fanci':210 'feather':427 'feel':155 'flag':444 'fluid':173 'forev':75 'forget':269 'form':118 'gather':425 'gazell':211 'golden':389 'gossip':358 'gravel':6 'grind':34 'grow':363 'harukami':280 'heart':146 'hillsid':9 'honey':432 'hull':39 'iceberg':36 'ideal':253 'imagin':257 'infant':441 'ink':69 'inscrib':65 'invad':113 'irretriev':337 'jar':433 'jukebox':151 'king':242 'laminar':171 'light':93,299 'like':209,276 'line':132 'liquid':91 'locat':127 'long':61,83 'longer':126 'look':163 'lost':199,326 'lover':74 'madrid':222 'manhattan':233 'marxist':231 'men':273 'mind':27 'moon':12 'moon-drawn':11 'moonlight':64 'movi':261 'music':30 'necklac':296 'neighborhood':122 'neither':264 'night':1,86,101,328,341,355,367,382,394,407,422,436 'nightstand':21 'novel':281 'obo':29 'octopus':162 'offic':419 'often':108 'paint':352 'past':112 'path':7 'paus':76 'peanut':308 'pearl':17 'pigeon':429 'pink':215 'place':140 'planet':3,103 'plant':416 'polish':20 'pool':213 'pot':415 'powder':314 'puls':165 'pulse-chang':164 'quicksilv':68 'raindrop':302 'rainwat':24 'rattl':288 'real':317 'reflect':300 'rememb':265 'repeat':110 'resembl':202 'riverlight':189 'rooftop':371 'root':413 'sake':275 'satellit':401 'school':208 'sea':375 'search':332 'self':26,42 'self-mind':25 'shadow':180 'shadow-drap':179 'shapeless':219 'shell':311 'shoot':212 'sing':144 'sip':283 'skin':159 'snowfal':236 'soft':22,218 'solid':87 'sometim':106,200 'song':148 'soul':45 'staircas':72 'star':28 'stoop':246 'strang':95 'street':131 'strong':364 'student':204 'sweater':220 'tast':306 'tight':216 'towpath':399 'trash':240 'trash-can':239 'trembl':376 'underfoot':315 'unforgett':137 'upon':18,77 'vain':334 'vineyard':14 'walk':397 'wander':330 'warren':129 'watch':373 'water':59,89 'way':157 'window':304 'women':282 'wonder':197,324 'yakuza':277 'yellow':351

239	The Catch	112		\nSomething has come between us— It will not sleep. Every night it rises like a fish Out of the deep. It cries with a human voice, It aches to be fed. Every night we heave it weeping Into our bed, With its heavy head lolled back, Its limbs hanging down, Like a mer-creature fetched up From the weeds of the drowned. Damp in the tidal dark, it whimpers, Tossing the cover,  Separating husband from wife, Lover from lover. It settles in the interstice, It spreads out its arms, While its cool underwater face Sharpens and warms: This is the third thing that makes Father and mother, The fierce love of our fashioning That will have no brother.\n	'ach':30 'arm':92 'back':48 'bed':42 'brother':121 'catch':2 'come':5 'cool':95 'cover':75 'creatur':57 'cri':24 'damp':66 'dark':70 'deep':22 'drown':65 'everi':12,34 'face':97 'fashion':116 'father':108 'fed':33 'fetch':58 'fierc':112 'fish':18 'hang':51 'head':46 'heav':37 'heavi':45 'human':27 'husband':77 'interstic':87 'like':16,53 'limb':50 'loll':47 'love':113 'lover':80,82 'make':107 'mer':56 'mer-creatur':55 'mother':110 'night':13,35 'rise':15 'separ':76 'settl':84 'sharpen':98 'sleep':11 'someth':3 'spread':89 'thing':105 'third':104 'tidal':69 'toss':73 'underwat':96 'us':7 'voic':28 'warm':100 'weed':62 'weep':39 'whimper':72 'wife':79

Jebediah said, "When and whereforth shall the bucolic blacks with good tempers come to see us pluck as Elizabeth Cotton intended?" We stole my Uncle Windchime's minivan, penned a simple   ballad about the drag of lovelessness and drove the end of the chitlin' circuit to a joint skinny as a walk-in temple where our new folk was not that new, but strengthened by our twelve bar conviction. A month later, in pulled a parade of well meaning alabaster post adolescents. We noticed the sand-tanned and braless ones piled in the ladder-backed front row with their boyfriends first because beneath our twangor slept what I'll call a hunger for the outlawable. One night J asked me when sisters like Chapman would arrive. I shook my chin wool then, and placed my hand over the guitar string's wind- ow til it stilled. "When the moon's black," I said.

Most people assumed a bear Like him couldn't read anything but a dollar, But I'd watched him tour the used bookstore In town and seen him napping so I knew he held more Than power in those hands. They could tear A Bible in two. Sometimes on the walk home I'd hear Him reciting poems. But come Friday, he was the one The fellas asked to speak to the boss.

243	Cocktails with Orpheus	113		\nAfter dark, the bar full of women part of me loves—the part that stood naked outside the window of Miss Geneva, recent divorcée who owned a gun, O Miss Geneva where are you now—Orpheus says she did not perish, she was not turned to ash in the brutal light, she found a good job, she made good money, she had her own insurance and a house, she was a decent wife. I know descent lives in the word decent. The bar noise makes a kind of silence. When Orpheus hands me his sunglasses, I see how fire changes everything. In the mind I am behind a woman whose skirt is hiked above her hips, as bound as touch permits, saying don't forget me when I become the liquid out of which names are born, salt-milk, milk-sweet and animal-made. I want to be a human above the body, uprooted and right, a fold of pleas released, but I am a black wound, what's left of the deed.\n	'anim':149 'animal-mad':148 'ash':50 'bar':7,86 'becom':132 'behind':110 'black':172 'bodi':159 'born':140 'bound':121 'brutal':53 'chang':103 'cocktail':1 'dark':5 'decent':75,84 'deed':179 'descent':79 'divorcé':27 'everyth':104 'fire':102 'fold':164 'forget':128 'found':56 'full':8 'geneva':25,34 'good':58,62 'gun':31 'hand':95 'hike':116 'hip':119 'hous':71 'human':156 'insur':68 'job':59 'kind':90 'know':78 'left':176 'light':54 'liquid':134 'live':80 'love':14 'made':61,150 'make':88 'milk':143,145 'milk-sweet':144 'mind':107 'miss':24,33 'money':63 'nake':19 'name':138 'nois':87 'o':32 'orpheus':3,39,94 'outsid':20 'own':29 'part':11,16 'perish':44 'permit':124 'plea':166 'recent':26 'releas':167 'right':162 'salt':142 'salt-milk':141 'say':40,125 'see':100 'silenc':92 'skirt':114 'stood':18 'sunglass':98 'sweet':146 'touch':123 'turn':48 'uproot':160 'want':152 'whose':113 'wife':76 'window':22 'woman':112 'women':10 'word':83 'wound':173
244	Mystic Bounce	113		\nEven if you love the racket of ascension, you must know how the power leaves you. And at this pitch who has time for meditation? the sea walled in by buildings. I do miss the quiet, don't you? When I said, "Fuck the deer antlered and hithered in fur," it was because I had seen the faces of presidents balled into a fist. If I were in charge, I would know how to fix the world: free health care or free physicals, at least, and an abiding love for the abstract. When I said, "All of history is saved for us," it was because I scorned the emancipated sky. Does the anthem choke you up?

245	The French Prisoner	114		\nIf only I could forget him, the Frenchman\r I saw outside our quarters, creeping round\r near daybreak in that density of garden\r as if he'd almost grown into the ground.\r He was just looking back, peering about him\r to check that he was safe here and alone:\r once he was sure, his plunder was all his!\r Whatever chanced, he'd not be moving on.\r He was already eating. He was wolfing\r a pilfered turnip hidden in his rags.\r Eating raw cattle feed. But he'd no sooner\r swallowed a mouthful than it made him gag;\r and the sweet food encountered on his tongue\r delight and then disgust, as it might be\r the unhappy and the happy, meeting in\r their bodies' all-consuming ecstasy.\r Only forget that body. . . Shoulder blades\r trembling, and a hand all skin and bone,\r the palm cramming his mouth in such a way\r that it too seemed to feed in clinging on.\r And then the furious and desperate shame\r of organs galled with one another, forced\r to tear from one another what should bind them\r together in community at last.\r The way his clumsy feet had been left out\r of all that gibbering bestial joy; and how\r they stood splayed out and paralyzed beneath\r the body's torture and fierce rapture now.\r And his look too—if I could forget that!\r Retching, he went on gobbling as if driven\r on and on, just to eat, no matter what,\r anything, this or that, himself even.\r Why go on? It turned out that he'd escaped\r from the prison camp nearby—guards came for him.\r I wander, as I did then in that garden,\r among my garden shadows here at home.\r "If only I could forget him, the Frenchman"—\r I'm looking through my notes, I read one out,\r and from my ears, my eyes, my mouth, the seething\r memory boils over in his shout:\r "I'm hungry!" And immediately I feel\r the undying hunger which this wretched creature\r has long since ceased to feel, for which there is\r no mitigating nourishment in nature.\r He feeds on me. More and more hungrily!\r And I'm less and less sufficient, for my part.\r Now he, who would have been contented once\r with any kind of food, demands my heart.\n	'all-consum':125 'almost':30 'alon':51 'alreadi':71 'among':281 'anoth':173,179 'anyth':247 'back':39 'beneath':212 'bestial':202 'bind':182 'blade':134 'bodi':124,132,214 'boil':317 'bone':142 'came':269 'camp':266 'cattl':85 'ceas':339 'chanc':62 'check':44 'cling':159 'clumsi':192 'communiti':186 'consum':127 'content':375 'could':7,227,291 'cram':145 'creatur':335 'creep':17 'd':29,64,89,261 'daybreak':20 'delight':108 'demand':382 'densiti':23 'desper':166 'disgust':111 'driven':237 'ear':309 'eat':72,83,243 'ecstasi':128 'encount':104 'escap':262 'even':252 'eye':311 'feed':86,157,352 'feel':328,341 'feet':193 'fierc':218 'food':103,381 'forc':174 'forget':8,130,228,292 'french':2 'frenchman':11,295 'furious':164 'gag':99 'gall':170 'garden':25,280,283 'gibber':201 'go':254 'gobbl':234 'ground':34 'grown':31 'guard':268 'hand':138 'happi':120 'heart':384 'hidden':79 'home':287 'hunger':331 'hungri':324 'hungrili':358 'immedi':326 'joy':203 'kind':379 'last':188 'left':196 'less':362,364 'long':337 'look':38,223,298 'm':297,323,361 'made':97 'matter':245 'meet':121 'memori':316 'might':114 'mitig':347 'mouth':94,147,313 'move':67 'natur':350 'near':19 'nearbi':267 'note':301 'nourish':348 'one':172,178,304 'organ':169 'outsid':14 'palm':144 'paralyz':211 'part':368 'peer':40 'pilfer':77 'plunder':57 'prison':3,265 'quarter':16 'rag':82 'raptur':219 'raw':84 'read':303 'retch':230 'round':18 'safe':48 'saw':13 'seem':155 'seeth':315 'shadow':284 'shame':167 'shoulder':133 'shout':321 'sinc':338 'skin':140 'sooner':91 'splay':208 'stood':207 'suffici':365 'sure':55 'swallow':92 'sweet':102 'tear':176 'togeth':184 'tongu':107 'tortur':216 'trembl':135 'turn':257 'turnip':78 'undi':330 'unhappi':117 'wander':273 'way':151,190 'went':232 'whatev':61 'wolf':75 'would':372 'wretch':334

252	Conversion Comedy	117		\n"I thought of you as a butterfly tonight," getting to eschatology from a sketchpad, your mom's. And though you write sermons nice and linear you also digress and about-face. The jeroboam trees are dark tonight. Darker in the outage than the stars let the sky be. Partyers all. The abbot told you, "I do not have power, the archbishop does not have power, the pope does not have power. Only God has power." Then it is not a kind of violence to put a photo of the Pope in a luscious hacienda, imperilled by a minature pullbell. Someone admired the hostess's oils. "Yes, it was a surprise when they hired me to teach but they said, 'We can teach an artist to teach but we can't teach a teacher to be an artist.'" "How true," the guests murmured. This was not your mother though artists all say it "comes from somewhere else." When another guest compared the Catholic to the Episcopal service she said, "I think not." In a desert once I almost fell off a cliff. To calm me down a friend told a joke: "Descartes was sitting on a plane. The stewardess said, 'Coffee or tea?' 'I think not,' Descartes said, and vanished." It took a moment to sink in because I thought he said "The cart" as in "beverage cart." Confusion is the only way to get to eschatology from a sketchpad. I'm trying to redeem that abbot. Drawing in the outage. Once you suggest the origins of music lay in the necessity of drowning out the cries of sacrificial victims, I start listening for them—the cries—under my own singing. Scholars resurrect books all the time just by quoting them. When Roman gods popped out of the soil, the Christians looked around wildly. Sculpt the mouth around "sculpture," ulpt. They reburied them hurriedly, and the earth gulped. The statue of the Commendatore went down with Don Giovanni. Which shall I believe, the unrepentence of the sinkholed Don? Or the statue that converts Leontes by resurrecting his all-forgiving wife? Hermione who's peerless has a likeness; he who won't about-face is not "mocked by art" but brought posthaste to hell, his "shapely seat and heart". . . The moon slips out like a foreign coin from denim: a drachma, an as. Can we redeem it? Cities are places are conversion, you said. But I am citiless.

Killing time, a life mostly miscues and hesitance, I want something to take me over so looked for you near the baggage claim's glide, who could have been  anybody from everywhere, like Ellis Island's ghosts, their dump of cardboard valises, bindles, baby-fat sacks strangled by hemp, and around me here long-haul lovers who in sleepers last night loved to exhaustion. Scorched roughnecks, perfumed girls in heels grabbing Samsonites and golf bags schooling the carousel's louvered U-turns and straightaways. It must be why I'm here, to wait and see who claims what looks too much like your brown suede duffel, no "Antigua" or "Cancun" decaled in its hide, nasal music threading the scene while tonight you weave through songs somewhere else. That floppy bag and us— the Garment District, two Venices, South End, South Philly, scraped nap, brass clips, gaunt warmed handle. . . A teenage girl two-hands it off the belt and waddles into the runny sun, your bag five years late thumping freshened thighs and dimpled knees. Where are you now that you're here again for me? Hear these thrilled voices,                                        the engine horn howling?                                                                                  Smell these acid residues?\n	'acid':269 'anoth':44 'antigua':180 'anybodi':99 'architectur':13 'around':121 'arriv':4 'babi':114 'baby-fat':113 'bag':146,202,238 'baggag':91 'belt':230 'bindl':112 'brass':216 'brown':176 'cabbi':53 'cancun':182 'cardboard':110 'carousel':149 'claim':92,169 'clip':217 'cloud':61 'could':96 'cowboy':48 'dark':60 'decal':183 'depot':10 'diego':6 'dimpl':246 'displac':15 'district':207 'dock':58 'duffel':178 'dump':108 'elli':103 'els':199 'end':211 'engin':264 'everybodi':45 'everywher':101 'exhaust':135 'far':26 'fat':115 'fe':9 'five':239 'fizzl':33 'floppi':201 'freshen':243 'fuss':62 'garment':206 'gaunt':218 'ghost':106 'girl':139,223 'glide':94 'golf':145 'grab':142 'hand':226 'handl':220 'happi':23 'haul':126 'hear':259 'heel':141 'hemp':119 'hesit':77 'hide':186 'home':28 'horn':265 'howl':266 'illeg':51 'imperfect':39 'island':104 'kid':17 'kill':70 'knee':247 'last':131 'late':241 'life':37,73 'light':35 'like':102,174 'live':38 'load':57 'long':125 'long-haul':124 'look':86,171 'louver':151 'love':133 'lover':127 'm':162 'mennonit':49 'miscu':75 'moorish':12 'most':74 'much':173 'music':188 'muslim':52 'must':158 'mystic':25 'nap':215 'nasal':187 'near':89 'night':132 'one':41 'pacif':1 'past':67 'perfum':138 'philli':213 'prayer':55 'prime':69 're':254 'residu':270 'room':31 'roughneck':137 'runni':235 'sack':116 'samsonit':143 'san':5 'santa':8 'satchel':19 'scene':191 'school':147 'scorch':136 'scrape':214 'see':167 'shed':22 'sleeper':130 'smell':267 'someth':80 'somewher':198 'song':197 'south':210,212 'souther':65 'squeaki':16 'straightaway':156 'strangl':117 'sued':177 'sun':66,236 'surflin':2 'take':82 'teenag':222 'thigh':244 'thread':189 'thrill':261 'thump':242 'tijuana':50 'tile':34 'time':71 'tonight':193 'trawl':18 'turn':154 'two':208,225 'two-hand':224 'u':153 'u-turn':152 'us':204 'valis':111 'venic':209 'voic':24,262 'waddl':232 'wait':30,165 'want':79 'warm':219 'weav':195 'year':240

291	The Cleaving	138		\nHe gossips like my grandmother, this man with my face, and I could stand amused all afternoon in the Hon Kee Grocery, amid hanging meats he chops: roast pork cut from a hog hung by nose and shoulders, her entire skin burnt crisp, flesh I know to be sweet, her shining face grinning up at ducks dangling single file, each pierced by black hooks through breast, bill, and steaming from a hole stitched shut at the ass. I step to the counter, recite, and he, without even slightly varying the rhythm of his current confession or harangue, scribbles my order on a greasy receipt, and chops it up quick. Such a sorrowful Chinese face, nomad, Gobi, Northern in its boniness clear from the high warlike forehead to the sheer edge of the jaw. He could be my brother, but finer, and, except for his left forearm, which is engorged, sinewy from his daily grip and wield of a two-pound tool, he's delicate, narrow- waisted, his frame so slight a lover, some rough other might break it down its smooth, oily length. In his light-handed calligraphy on receipts and in his moodiness, he is a Southerner from a river-province; suited for scholarship, his face poised above an open book, he’d mumble his favorite passages. He could be my grandfather; come to America to get a Western education in 1917, but too homesick to study, he sits in the park all day, reading poems and writing letters to his mother. He lops the head off, chops the neck of the duck into six, slits the body open, groin to breast, and drains the scalding juices, then quarters the carcass with two fast hacks of the cleaver, old blade that has worn into the surface of the round foot-thick chop-block a scoop that cradles precisely the curved steel. The head, flung from the body, opens down the middle where the butcher cleanly halved it between the eyes, and I see, foetal-crouched inside the skull, the homunculus, gray brain grainy to eat. Did this animal, after all, at the moment its neck broke, image the way his executioner shrinks from his own death? Is this how I, too, recoil from my day? See how this shape hordes itself, see how little it is. See its grease on the blade. Is this how I’ll be found when judgement is passed, when names are called, when crimes are tallied? This is also how I looked before I tore my mother open. Is this how I presided over my century, is this how I regarded the murders? This is also how I prayed. Was it me in the Other I prayed to when I prayed? This too was how I slept, clutching my wife. Was it me in the other I loved when I loved another? The butcher sees me eye this delicacy. With a finger, he picks it out of the skull-cradle and offers it to me. I take it gingerly between my fingers and suck it down. I eat my man. The noise the body makes when the body meets the soul over the soul’s ocean and penumbra is the old sound of up-and-down, in-and-out, a lump of muscle chug-chugging blood into the ear; a lover’s heart-shaped tongue; flesh rocking flesh until flesh comes; the butcher working at his block and blade to marry their shapes by violence and time; an engine crossing, re-crossing salt water, hauling immigrants and the junk of the poor. These are the faces I love, the bodies and scents of bodies for which I long in various ways, at various times, thirteen gathered around the redwood, happy, talkative, voracious at day’s end, eager to eat four kinds of meat prepared four different ways, numerous plates and bowls of rice and vegetables, each made by distinct affections and brought to table by many hands. Brothers and sisters by blood and design, who sit in separate bodies of varied shapes, we constitute a many-membered body of love. In a world of shapes of my desires, each one here is a shape of one of my desires, and each is known to me and dear by virtue of each one’s unique corruption of those texts, the face, the body: that jut jaw to gnash tendon; that wide nose to meet the blows a face like that invites; those long eyes closing on the seen; those thick lips to suck the meat of animals or recite 300 poems of the T’ang; these teeth to bite my monosyllables; these cheekbones to make those syllables sing the soul. Puffed or sunken according to the life, dark or light according to the birth, straight or humped, whole, manqué, quasi, each pleases, verging on utter grotesquery. All are beautiful by variety. The soul too is a debasement of a text, but, thus, it acquires salience, although a human salience, but inimitable, and, hence, memorable. God is the text. The soul is a corruption and a mnemonic. A bright moment, I hold up an old head from the sea and admire the haughty down-curved mouth that seems to disdain all the eyes are blind to, including me, the eater. Whole unto itself, complete without me, yet its shape complements the shape of my mind. I take it as text and evidence of the world’s love for me, and I feel urged to utterance, urged to read the body of the world, urged to say it in human terms, my reading a kind of eating, my eating a kind of reading, my saying a diminishment, my noise a love-in-answer. What is it in me would devour the world to utter it? What is it in me will not let the world be, would eat not just this fish, but the one who killed it, the butcher who cleaned it. I would eat the way he squats, the way he reaches into the plastic tubs and pulls out a fish, clubs it, takes it to the sink, guts it, drops it on the weighing pan. I would eat that thrash and plunge of the watery body in the water, that liquid violence between the man’s hands, I would eat the gutless twitching on the scales, three pounds of dumb nerve and pulse, I would eat it all to utter it. The deaths at the sinks, those bodies prepared for eating, I would eat, and the standing deaths at the counters, in the aisles, the walking deaths in the streets, the death-far-from-home, the death- in-a-strange-land, these Chinatown deaths, these American deaths. I would devour this race to sing it, this race that according to Emerson managed to preserve to a hair for three or four thousand years the ugliest features in the world.

256	From the Towers	119		\nInsanity is not a want of reason. It is reason's overgrowth, a calculating kudzu. Explaining why, in two-ton manifesti, thinkers sally forth with testaments and pipe bombs. Heaven help us: spare us all your meaningful designs. Shine down or shower forth, but (for the earthling's sake) ignore all prayers followed by against, or for. Teach us to bear life's senselessness, our insignificance, and more; let's call that sanity. The terrifying prospect isn't some escapist with a novel, fond of comfort, munching sweets— it is the busy hermeneut, so serious he's sour, intent on making meaning of us all, and bursting from the towers to the streets.\n	'bear':65 'bomb':33 'burst':111 'busi':96 'calcul':17 'call':75 'comfort':90 'design':42 'earthl':51 'escapist':84 'explain':19 'follow':57 'fond':88 'forth':28,47 'heaven':34 'help':35 'hermeneut':97 'ignor':54 'insan':4 'insignific':70 'intent':103 'isn':81 'kudzu':18 'let':73 'life':66 'make':105 'manifesti':25 'mean':106 'meaning':41 'munch':91 'novel':87 'overgrowth':15 'pipe':32 'prayer':56 'prospect':80 'reason':10,13 'sake':53 'salli':27 'saniti':77 'senseless':68 'serious':99 'shine':43 'shower':46 'sour':102 'spare':37 'street':117 'sweet':92 'teach':62 'terrifi':79 'testament':30 'thinker':26 'ton':24 'tower':3,114 'two':23 'two-ton':22 'us':36,38,63,108 'want':8
257	Space Bar	119		\nLined up behind the space bartender is the meaning of it all, the vessels marked with letters, numbers, signs.

260	Dropping the euphemism	121		\nHe has five children, I’m papa to a hundred pencils. I bought the chair he sat in from a book of chairs, staplers and spikes that let me play Vlad the Impaler with invading memos. When I said I have to lay you off a parallel universe was born in his face, one where flesh is a loose shirt taken to the river and beaten against rocks. Just by opening my mouth I destroyed his faith he’s a man who can think honey-glazed ham and act out the thought with plastic or bills. We sat. I stared at my hands, he stared at the wall staring at my hands. I said other things about the excellent work he’d done and the cycles of business which are like the roller-coaster thoughts of an oscilloscope. All this time I saw the eyes of his wife which had always been brown like almonds but were now brown like the crust of bread. We walked to the door, I shook his hand, felt the bones pretending to be strong. On his way home there was a happy song because de Sade invented radio, the window was open, he saw delphinium but couldn’t remember the name. I can only guess. Maybe at each exit that could have led his body to Tempe, to Mars, he was tempted to forget his basketball team of sons, or that he ever liked helping his wife clean carrots, the silver sink turning orange. Running’s natural to most animals who aren’t part of a lecture series on Nature’s Dead Ends. When I told him, I saw he was looking for a place in his brain to hide his brain. I tried that later with beer, it worked until I stood at the toilet to make my little waterfall, and thought of him pushing back from a bar to go make the same noise.\n	'act':93 'almond':160 'alway':156 'anim':261 'aren':263 'back':318 'bar':321 'basketbal':237 'beaten':69 'beer':299 'bill':100 'bodi':226 'bone':181 'book':24 'born':53 'bought':16 'brain':289,293 'bread':169 'brown':158,164 'busi':132 'carrot':250 'chair':18,26 'children':7 'clean':249 'coaster':139 'could':222 'couldn':208 'crust':167 'cycl':130 'd':126 'de':196 'dead':273 'delphinium':206 'destroy':78 'done':127 'door':174 'drop':1 'end':274 'euphem':3 'ever':244 'excel':123 'exit':220 'eye':150 'face':56 'faith':80 'felt':179 'five':6 'flesh':59 'forget':235 'glaze':90 'go':323 'guess':216 'ham':91 'hand':107,116,178 'happi':193 'help':246 'hide':291 'home':189 'honey':89 'honey-glaz':88 'hundr':13 'impal':36 'invad':38 'invent':198 'later':297 'lay':46 'lectur':268 'led':224 'let':31 'like':135,159,165,245 'littl':311 'look':283 'loos':62 'm':9 'make':309,324 'man':84 'mar':230 'mayb':217 'memo':39 'mouth':76 'name':212 'natur':258,271 'nois':327 'one':57 'open':74,203 'orang':255 'oscilloscop':143 'papa':10 'parallel':50 'part':265 'pencil':14 'place':286 'plastic':98 'play':33 'pretend':182 'push':317 'radio':199 'rememb':210 'river':67 'rock':71 'roller':138 'roller-coast':137 'run':256 'sade':197 'said':42,118 'sat':20,102 'saw':148,205,280 'seri':269 'shirt':63 'shook':176 'silver':252 'sink':253 'son':240 'song':194 'spike':29 'stapler':27 'stare':104,109,113 'stood':304 'strong':185 'taken':64 'team':238 'temp':228 'tempt':233 'thing':120 'think':87 'thought':96,140,314 'time':146 'toilet':307 'told':277 'tri':295 'turn':254 'univers':51 'vlad':34 'walk':171 'wall':112 'waterfal':312 'way':188 'wife':153,248 'window':201 'work':124,301
261	Spirit ditty of no fax-line dial tone	121		\nThe telephone company calls and asks what the fuss is. Betty from the telephone company, who’s not concerned with the particulars of my life. For instance if I believe in the transubstantiation of Christ or am gladdened at 7:02 in the morning to repeat an eighth time why a man wearing a hula skirt of tools slung low on his hips must a fifth time track mud across my white kitchen tile to look down at a phone jack. Up to a work order. Down at a phone jack. Up to a work order. Over at me. Down at a phone jack. Up to a work order before announcing the problem I have is not the problem I have because the problem I have cannot occur in this universe though possibly in an alternate universe which is not the responsibility or in any way the product, child, or subsidiary of AT&T. With practice I’ve come to respect this moment. One man in jeans, t-shirt and socks looking across space at a man with probes and pliers of various inclinations, nothing being said for five or ten seconds, perhaps I’m still in pajamas and he has a cleft pallet or is so tall that gigantism comes to mind but I can’t remember what causes flesh to pile that high, five or ten seconds of taking in and being taken in by eyes and a brain, during which I don’t build a shot gun from what’s at hand, oatmeal and National Geographics, or a taser from hair caught in the drain and the million volts of frustration popping through my body. Even though. Even though his face is an abstract painting called Void. Even though I’m wondering if my pajama flap is open, placing me at a postural disadvantage.

262	Quaker Meeting, The Sixties	122		\nSeeing my friend’s son in his broad-brimmed hat and suspenders, I think of the Quakers who lectured us on nonviolent social action every week when I was a child. In the classrooms we listened to those who would not take up arms, who objected, who had accepted alternative service in distant work camps and showed slides of hospitals they helped to build. On Wednesdays, in Meeting for Worship, when someone rose to speak, all the energy in the room flew inside her mouth, empowering her to tell what she had seen on her brief encounter with the divine: sometimes, a parable, a riddle, a kindness. The fall that we were seventeen, we scuffed our loafers on the gravelly path from the Meetinghouse, while maple and elm leaves sailed around our shoulders   like tiny envelopes, our futures sealed inside. Despite the war in Vietnam, I felt safer than I ever would again. Perhaps those aged, protective trees had cast a spell on us, or maybe the nonviolent Quaker God had set up a kingdom right there— suburban Philadelphia. Looking back, I see how good deeds and thoughts climbed with us to the attic room for Latin, descended to the gym for sports, where we hung from the praiseworthy scaffolds of righteous behavior. We prepared to leave for college, armed with the language of the American Friends and the memories of Thanksgiving dinners we’d cooked for the unfortunates: borrowing our parents’ cars to drive downtown to the drop-off point, racing back to play our last field hockey match. Grim center forwards shook hands before the whistle, the half-backs’ knee-pads strapped on tight; one varsity team vanquished another.\n	'accept':54 'action':29 'age':161 'altern':55 'american':231 'anoth':289 'arm':49,225 'around':136 'attic':199 'back':186,259,278 'behavior':218 'borrow':245 'brief':101 'brim':14 'broad':13 'broad-brim':12 'build':69 'camp':60 'car':248 'cast':165 'center':268 'child':36 'classroom':39 'climb':194 'colleg':224 'cook':241 'd':240 'deed':191 'descend':203 'despit':146 'dinner':238 'distant':58 'divin':105 'downtown':251 'drive':250 'drop':255 'drop-off':254 'elm':133 'empow':91 'encount':102 'energi':83 'envelop':141 'ever':156 'everi':30 'fall':114 'felt':152 'field':264 'flew':87 'forward':269 'friend':7,232 'futur':143 'god':175 'good':190 'gravelli':125 'grim':267 'gym':206 'half':277 'half-back':276 'hand':271 'hat':15 'help':67 'hockey':265 'hospit':65 'hung':211 'insid':88,145 'kind':112 'kingdom':180 'knee':280 'knee-pad':279 'languag':228 'last':263 'latin':202 'leav':134,222 'lectur':24 'like':139 'listen':41 'loafer':122 'look':185 'mapl':131 'match':266 'mayb':171 'meet':2,73 'meetinghous':129 'memori':235 'mouth':90 'nonviol':27,173 'object':51 'one':285 'pad':281 'parabl':108 'parent':247 'path':126 'perhap':159 'philadelphia':184 'play':261 'point':257 'praiseworthi':214 'prepar':220 'protect':162 'quaker':1,22,174 'race':258 'riddl':110 'right':181 'righteous':217 'room':86,200 'rose':78 'safer':153 'sail':135 'scaffold':215 'scuf':120 'seal':144 'see':5,188 'seen':98 'servic':56 'set':177 'seventeen':118 'shook':270 'shoulder':138 'show':62 'sixti':4 'slide':63 'social':28 'someon':77 'sometim':106 'son':9 'speak':80 'spell':167 'sport':208 'strap':282 'suburban':183 'suspend':17 'take':47 'team':287 'tell':94 'thanksgiv':237 'think':19 'thought':193 'tight':284 'tini':140 'tree':163 'unfortun':244 'us':25,169,196 'vanquish':288 'varsiti':286 'vietnam':150 'war':148 'wednesday':71 'week':31 'whistl':274 'work':59 'worship':75 'would':45,157
263	Opals	122		\nI knew the hard winter of sapphires set within gold claws, amber and pipestone strung on gut, fringed pouches stuffed with hash. Separate, separate, I urged her that summer of Woodstock, when I lied to get the car and draped my love beads around the neck of someone else’s sister. In a hayloft in Ohio my friend lifted three bales to show me a litter of week-old kittens, each pair of eyes infected with a slimy mucus. Their pupils swam in opaque opal membranes and they would have gone blind if she had not pulled an eyedropper of antibiotics from her jacket, doing what the mother cat could not do, what the owners would not trouble themselves to do, doing what a sister or friend might do if she took the time to attend the wayward, opalescent unhappiness in this world.\n	'amber':13 'antibiot':103 'around':45 'attend':138 'bale':62 'bead':44 'blind':94 'car':39 'cat':111 'claw':12 'could':112 'drape':41 'els':50 'eye':76 'eyedropp':101 'friend':59,129 'fring':19 'get':37 'gold':11 'gone':93 'gut':18 'hard':5 'hash':23 'hayloft':55 'infect':77 'jacket':106 'kitten':72 'knew':3 'lie':35 'lift':60 'litter':67 'love':43 'membran':88 'might':130 'mother':110 'mucus':81 'neck':47 'ohio':57 'old':71 'opal':1,87 'opalesc':141 'opaqu':86 'owner':117 'pair':74 'pipeston':15 'pouch':20 'pull':99 'pupil':83 'sapphir':8 'separ':24,25 'set':9 'show':64 'sister':52,127 'slimi':80 'someon':49 'strung':16 'stuf':21 'summer':30 'swam':84 'three':61 'time':136 'took':134 'troubl':120 'unhappi':142 'urg':27 'wayward':140 'week':70 'week-old':69 'winter':6 'within':10 'woodstock':32 'world':145 'would':91,118

Nothing can be said for suffering. It is legible only to strangers and at great distances. It detests survivors. It drapes gun-carriages with flowers, lampposts with hanging boys. It is the right time for hallucinations, most nakedly of inmost west. Her death would be less tender now, dusted over with charity, a web of useless wings, a shallow sty.

266	Warm Days in January	123		\nIt has never been so easy to cry openly or to acknowledge children. Never before could I walk directly to the center of an island city feeling the automatism of millions drawing one pious breath, shouldering the sunset, holding it up in the oily tree-line a while longer. Years ago, I was never sad enough and nothing but a hotel that I could tear to pieces and reconstruct inside a shoebox felt like home. My parents died. Their miserable possessions washed up in other hotels, dioramas of the febrile romantic. I take my first lover, already gray at her temples and more reticent than shy, more tacit than admiring, to the bus stop by the Jewish Museum. We wait in the dark a long time. She does not kiss me. She hurries up out of the oily street onto the humming, fluorescent podium of the last bus where I see her a last time, not waving to me, not lovable, erect in the freedom we traduced years ago in our first kiss. Never deny the power of withdrawal. Never doubt that thought and time make things small. Never refuse the easy exit line or prescribed uncomprehending gesture. At childhood’s end, none can tell happiness from buoyancy. None of it made any difference— the patricides, the hotels ill-constructed, the inconstant starlight of drugs and rebellion. We are no more complicated than our great-grandparents who dreaded the hotel life. Like them, we seek the refuge of warm days in January, a piety whose compulsion is to survive according to explicit laws no young woman adores or young man follows with darling hunger.\n	'accord':267 'acknowledg':16 'admir':115 'ador':274 'ago':56,174 'alreadi':102 'automat':33 'breath':39 'buoyanc':213 'bus':118,153 'center':26 'childhood':205 'children':17 'citi':30 'complic':238 'compuls':263 'construct':226 'could':20,69 'cri':12 'dark':128 'darl':280 'day':2,257 'deni':180 'die':83 'differ':219 'diorama':92 'direct':23 'doubt':186 'draw':36 'dread':245 'drug':231 'easi':10,197 'end':207 'enough':61 'erect':167 'exit':198 'explicit':269 'febril':95 'feel':31 'felt':78 'first':100,177 'fluoresc':148 'follow':278 'freedom':170 'gestur':203 'grandpar':243 'gray':103 'great':242 'great-grandpar':241 'happi':211 'hold':43 'home':80 'hotel':66,91,223,247 'hum':147 'hunger':281 'hurri':138 'ill':225 'ill-construct':224 'inconst':228 'insid':75 'island':29 'januari':4,259 'jewish':122 'kiss':135,178 'last':152,159 'law':270 'life':248 'like':79,249 'line':51,199 'long':130 'longer':54 'lovabl':166 'lover':101 'made':217 'make':191 'man':277 'million':35 'miser':85 'museum':123 'never':7,18,59,179,185,194 'none':208,214 'noth':63 'oili':48,143 'one':37 'onto':145 'open':13 'parent':82 'patricid':221 'piec':72 'pieti':261 'pious':38 'podium':149 'possess':86 'power':182 'prescrib':201 'rebellion':233 'reconstruct':74 'refug':254 'refus':195 'retic':109 'romant':96 'sad':60 'see':156 'seek':252 'shi':111 'shoebox':77 'shoulder':40 'small':193 'starlight':229 'stop':119 'street':144 'sunset':42 'surviv':266 'tacit':113 'take':98 'tear':70 'tell':210 'templ':106 'thing':192 'thought':188 'time':131,160,190 'traduc':172 'tree':50 'tree-lin':49 'uncomprehend':202 'wait':125 'walk':22 'warm':1,256 'wash':87 'wave':162 'whose':262 'withdraw':184 'woman':273 'year':55,173 'young':272,276
267	Last	123		\nThe unsigned architecture of loneliness is becoming taller, finding a way farther above the horizontal flowering of the Cold War, the peonies and star asters of wild partisanship. I have a shambling gait and lonely hysteria, but no Terror. I am free to shamble past the vacant lot of my son’s conception, to shamble past the bar where I conceived adultery as a Terror that would be endless, flowering in great waves through air striated like chenille. I walk for a long time and try to conjure elsewhere in its early isolation. I cannot. It is all redestinated by the future like the loose balloons a janitor recovers at 6 am from cold light fixtures. The Cold War is ending. Buildings are taller and have no names. 1. The romance of every ideology torments the romance of another. How beautifully, in the beginning, in the gale and embrace of isolation, boys capered over a shambles and swore oaths. The scent of urine in the hall at home was righteousness. The beautiful nude obscured by dust in a paperweight was righteousness. Neglectful townships coming into steep flower just as boys were flowering needed the correction of righteousness,   the horizontal slag of government by children. Only the insane allegiances endure. The mad counterparts are lovers passion cannot explain nor circumstances restrict to the dead zones of irony. A counterpart of end of the Cold War is adultery. A counterpart of loving a divided Berlin unto death is fatherhood, the doting maintenance of sons in vacant lots continuing the wars of rubble for righteousness’ sake and for the sake of nudes obscured by dust and vulgarity. Romance torments romance. The most beautiful moment of the twentieth century galed and embraced the acrid smoky air as the Red Army entered Berlin as Hitler shriveled in the gasoline fire as Red Army flags opened above Berlin safeguarding the ruins of a changeless future. Townships blackened even as they flowered. Loose balloons cluttered the low sky and sun. I walked for a long time and tried to conjure the form of kindness. It was a domestic animal confused in the tall grass. Boys set fire to the grass. History that opens flags opened the fire, and Berlin, divided from Berlin, began to love its children past all reason. 2. My son reads sermons of pain and writes on walls. He starves the ground he walks on, preparing a dead city to be worthy of its new flags, to shine as exploded windows shine, raining down for hours after the wrecking crews have gone. I have a lover now who hates children. The hatred floats inside of her, a weightless sexual pavilion of perfect form and perfect emptiness. I thought by making love to her I would conceive nothing but Terror, outrage upon outrage, a violence that would last my whole life and free my son. I was ignorant as a balloon. Across the luminous expressway, I see the shapes of charred tenements castellated, fading into the more tender shapes of night. It may be the last night in history. Tomorrow pulls down the Berlin Wall, pulls down my honor, and I return to my lover’s bed to float in a white condom, no longer my son’s father. Tomorrow describes everything in detail. It explains nothing. It does not teach my boy that tenements are better than the future, better that peace, more likely to produce brothers than are the glassy hands of mornings without end or walls denuded of their wire. In the dead zone of irony before dawn, only the cats cry, like martyrs in the flame. 3. Gates everywhere. The Brandenburg. The Great Gate of Kiev beneath which children stride onto an invisible crescendo disappearing into gasoline fires, emerging as the new shapes of righteousness in slow vans through the Brandenburg Gate. Oaths are secret because none suspects that they are kept. They thrust themselves towards us unashamedly, like the insane homeless, and we do not see them. In our loneliness, we see a chance for love in betrayal, not death. In our loneliness, we see the happy triumph of glassy hands in free elections, not the denuding of Berlin or wanderings of children in vans reduced by fire to black transparencies in the morning shade. When Joan of Arc surrendered to the flames she cried out “Jesus, Jesus.” Some years later, a failed magician who had lover her cried out “Joan, Joan” as the flames mocked him with a sortilege too easy to be unreal or profitable. I walk for a long time and try to conjure the form of loneliness without Cold War. It is ash upon ash, a chiaroscuro aloft and on the ground, completely still. Oaths are secret because none suspects the desperation of every object, the child in every atom of the misused world thrust towards us, crying out whatever sacred name it witnessed put to death on the ascending music of a wall. Our buildings are tall and have no names. The parks grow glassy hands instead of flowers. 4. Afterwards, the calm is piteous but insubstantial as a smell of burn that does not rise in smoke or dies with the fire. Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise and having to invent air, invent light from nothing but untriggered memory. All things beloved are recalled to pain. Air recollected from the wrists of girls braceleted for Confirmation, crossed. Light recollected from between the cars of night trains in a deep river valley where islands in the river glowed like swans. Air recollected form a ditch in flower. Light recollected from the sex of flowers in bare rooms, the grainy light of blondes. Air recollected from religion. Light recollected form the incensed clutch of bodies before sunrise in the oaths of a great and ignorant lost cause. Imagine walking out of a house at sunrise having spent the night in bed with a stranger. Aloft and on the ground the calm unfurls like flags without device or slogan. The inconsequence of the day ahead stirs airless atmospheres in darkness visible as daylight but without shade. Without Cold War, without the arbitrary demarcation of cause from cause, of light and air from the unsexed improvisations of memory, I cannot see to walk or breathe to breathe. Sex becomes applause. Sex becomes television, and the bastard avant garde of lonely architecture breaks ground at the unwired heart of a city that marks the capital of nothing now. 5. A scratchy, recorded call to prayer crosses the alley from one new building into mine. The consolations of history are furtive, then fugitive, then forgotten like a bar of music that might have been obscene or sacred once, in another city, in the days before today. My son is well. He works the public ground and needs no Antigone. My lover sits beside him at dinner, sharing a joke, unmapping the tall future and its unbiased children, reinventing the sexual pavilion to accommodate plague wards. Romance forgives romance. The early isolation of this gorgeous century disappears into good works. The future is best. To put a final stop to the grotesque unmercy of martyrdom and to the ruinous armies of mad boys whose government is rape, whose justice is a wall, revoke all partisanship, adjourn the Terror. The future is best. It unobscures the dusty nudes. It protects the river islands and their glowing swans. But when I need to die, who will light the fire? What names shall I cry out and what music burn to a black transparency in my heart? The unborn have been revoked. They will not be kind.\n	'1':130 '2':385 '3':607 '4':846 '5':1084 '6':112 'accommod':1167 'acrid':291 'across':488 'adjourn':1219 'adulteri':63,237 'afterward':847 'ahead':1012

308	James Schuyler	45		\nI went to his sixty-sixth birthday dinner: sixteen years ago this past November. I remember that it was at Chelsea Central (his favorite restaurant: great steaks) on 10th Avenue, and that Ashbery was there, and a few others, including Joe, impeccably dressed and gracious, who picked up what must have been (I thought at the time) an exorbitant bill. I remember him saying more than once, “Joe always picks up the bill,” then smiling a slightly wicked smile. Sitting with him (those excruciating silences!) in his room at the Chelsea, my eyes would wander from his book- shelves (The Portrait of a Lady stood out) to the pan of water on the radiator to the records strewn on the floor to some scraggly plants (ivy? herbs?) in ceramic pots at the base of the French doors that opened to the balcony and balustrade and sound of traffic on 23rd Street six floors below. He read me “White Boat, Blue Boat” shortly after he wrote it, and a poem about Brook Benton singing “Rainy Night in Georgia” that didn’t make it into his Last Poems, though I remember thinking it beautiful. He complained, in a letter to Tom, about how much I smoked, and how emotional I’d get during movies: he must have been referring to Field of Dreams (he had a yen for Kevin Costner). When he took me to see L'Atalante, a film he loved, I was bored. Once, we took the subway (he hadn’t ridden it in years) to the Frick; I remember admiring Romney’s Lady Hamilton. It hurt that he didn’t invite me to the dinner after his Dia reading or to the reception after his reading at the 92nd Street Y, though he did, at the latter, read “Mood Indigo,” dedicated to me. When he said my name from the stage, Joan and Eileen, sitting to my left, turned and stared at me; frozen by the enormity of the moment, I couldn’t look back. When he came to a reading I gave at St. Mark’s, Raymond impressed upon me what an honor it was: Jimmy didn’t go to many poetry readings. What else is there to say? That when I visited him at St. Vincent’s the day before he died Darragh said, “He likes to hear gossip.” So I said, “Eileen and I are talking again.” That at his funeral I sat alone (Ira couldn’t come); that that was the loneliest feeling in the world. That afterwards Doug said “You look so sad.” How should I have looked, Doug! And that a year after he died, I dreamt I saw him in the lobby of the Chelsea Hotel. He was wearing a hospital shift and seemed to have no muscle control over his face—like in inten- sive care after his stroke. He saw me and said, “It’s nice to see some familiar faces.” I approached him, but he disappeared.\n	'10th':32 '23rd':153 '92nd':293 'admir':264 'afterward':426 'ago':14 'alon':411 'alway':72 'approach':496 'ashberi':36 'atalant':239 'avenu':33 'back':339 'balconi':145 'balustrad':147 'base':136 'beauti':195 'benton':175 'bill':63,76 'birthday':10 'blue':163 'boat':162,164 'book':101 'bore':246 'brook':174 'came':342 'care':478 'central':25 'ceram':132 'chelsea':24,94,456 'come':415 'complain':197 'control':470 'costner':231 'couldn':336,413 'd':212 'darragh':389 'day':385 'dedic':305 'dia':282 'didn':182,273,362 'die':388,445 'dinner':11,279 'disappear':500 'door':140 'doug':427,438 'dream':224 'dreamt':447 'dress':46 'eileen':318,399 'els':370 'emot':210 'enorm':331 'excruci':87 'exorbit':62 'eye':96 'face':473,494 'familiar':493 'favorit':27 'feel':421 'field':222 'film':241 'floor':124,156 'french':139 'frick':261 'frozen':328 'funer':408 'gave':347 'georgia':180 'get':213 'go':364 'gossip':395 'gracious':48 'great':29 'hadn':253 'hamilton':268 'hear':394 'herb':130 'honor':358 'hospit':462 'hotel':457 'hurt':270 'impecc':45 'impress':353 'includ':43 'indigo':304 'inten':476 'invit':275 'ira':412 'ivi':129 'jame':1 'jimmi':361 'joan':316 'joe':44,71 'kevin':230 'l':238 'ladi':107,267 'last':188 'latter':301 'left':322 'letter':200 'like':392,474 'lobbi':453 'loneliest':420 'look':338,430,437 'love':243 'make':184 'mani':366 'mark':350 'moment':334 'mood':303 'movi':215 'much':205 'muscl':469 'must':53,217 'name':312 'nice':489 'night':178 'novemb':17 'open':142 'other':42 'pan':112 'past':16 'pick':50,73 'plant':128 'poem':172,189 'poetri':367 'portrait':104 'pot':133 'radiat':117 'raini':177 'raymond':352 'read':159,283,290,302,345,368 'recept':287 'record':120 'refer':220 'rememb':19,65,192,263 'restaur':28 'ridden':255 'romney':265 'room':91 'sad':432 'said':310,390,398,428,486 'sat':410 'saw':449,483 'say':67,374 'schuyler':2 'scragg':127 'see':237,491 'seem':465 'shelv':102 'shift':463 'short':165 'silenc':88 'sing':176 'sit':83,319 'sive':477 'six':155 'sixteen':12 'sixth':9 'sixti':8 'sixty-sixth':7 'slight':80 'smile':78,82 'smoke':207 'sound':149 'st':349,381 'stage':315 'stare':325 'steak':30 'stood':108 'street':154,294 'strewn':121 'stroke':481 'subway':251 'talk':403 'think':193 'though':190,296 'thought':57 'time':60 'tom':202 'took':234,249 'traffic':151 'turn':323 'upon':354 'vincent':382 'visit':378 'wander':98 'water':114 'wear':460 'went':4 'white':161 'wick':81 'world':424 'would':97 'wrote':168 'y':295 'year':13,258,442 'yen':228

275	At Night the States	131		\nAt night the states I forget them or I wish I was there           in that one under the Stars. It smells like June in this night           so sweet like air. I may have decided that the           States are not that tired Or I have thought so. I have           thought that. At night the states And the world not that tired           of everyone Maybe. Honey, I think that to           say is in light. Or whoever. We will           never replace you. We will never re-           place You. But in like a dream the floor is no             longer discursive To me it doesn’t please me by           being the vistas out my window, do you know what           Of course (not) I mean? I have no dreams of wake-           fulness. In wakefulness. And so to begin.           (my love.) At night the states talk. My initial continuing contr-           diction my love for you & that for me deep down in the Purple Plant the oldest           dust of it is sweetest but states no longer           how I would feel. Shirt that shirt has been in your arms           And I have that shirt is how I feel At night the states will you continue in this as-           sociation of matters, my Dearest? down           the street from where the public plaque reminds           that of private loving the consequential chain           trail is matters At night the states that it doesn’t matter that I don’t           say them, remember them at the end of this claustro-           phobic the dance, I wish I could see I wish           I could dance her. At this night the states           say them out there. That I am, am them           indefinitely so and so wishful passive historic fated           and matter- simple, matter-simple, an           eyeful. I wish but I don’t and little melody.           Sorry that these little things don’t happen any           more. The states have drained their magicks           for I have not seen them. Best not to tell. But           you you would always remain, I             trust, as I will always be alone. At night the states whistle. Anyone can live. I can. I am not doing any-           thing doing this. I discover I love as I figure. Wed-           nesday I wanted to say something in           particular. I have been where. I have seen it. The God           can. The people do some more. At night the states I let go of, have let, don’t           let Some, and some, in Florida, doing.           What takes you so long? I am still with you in that           part of the park, and vice will continue, but           I’ll have a cleaning Maine. Who loses           these names loses. I can’t bring it up yet,           keeping my opinions to herself. Everybody in           any room is a smuggler. I walked fiery and             talked in the stars of the automatic weapons           and partly for you Which you. You know. At night the states have told it already. Have           told it. I know it. But more that they           don’t know, I know it too. At night the states whom I do stand before in           judgment, I think that they will find           me fair, not that they care in fact nor do           I, right now though indeed I am they and           we say that not that I’ve           erred nor lost my way though perhaps           they did (did they) and now he is dead           but you you are not. Yet I am this           one, lost again? lost & found by one-           self Who are you to dare sing to me? At night the states accompany me while I sit here           or drums there are always drums what for           so I won’t lose my way the name of           a personality, say, not California           I am not sad for you though I could be           I remember climbing up a hill under tall           trees getting home. I was going to say that the air was           fair (I was always saying something like           that) but that’s not it now, and that           that’s not it isn’t it either At night the states dare sing to me they who seem           tawdry any more I’ve not thought I           loved them, only you it’s you whom I love the states are not good to me as           I am to them though perhaps I am not when I think of your being           so beautiful but is that your beauty           or could it be theirs I’m having such a           hard time remembering any of their names your being beautiful belongs           to nothing I don’t believe they should           praise you but I seem to believe they           should somehow let you go At night the states and when you go down to           Washington witness how perfectly anything           in particular sheets of thoughts what a waste           of sheets at night. I remember something           about an up-to-date theory of time. I           have my own white rose for I have           done something well but I’m not           clear what it is. Weathered, perhaps           but that’s never done. What’s done is           perfection. At night the states ride the train to Baltimore we will try to acknowledge what was but that’s not the real mirror           is it? nor is it empty, or only my eyes           are Ride the car home from Washington           no they are not. Ride the subway           home from Pennsylvania Station. The states           are blind eyes stony smooth shut in moon-           light. My French is the shape of this           book that means I. At night the states the 14 pieces. I couldn’t just walk on by. Why aren’t they beautiful enough in a way that does not           beg to wring something from a dry (wet)           something Call my name At night the states making life, not explaining anything but all the popular songs say call           my name oh call my name, and if I call           it out myself to you, call mine out instead as our           poets do will you still walk on by? I           have loved you for so long. You           died and on the wind they sang           your name to me but you said nothing. Yet you           said once before and there it is, there, but it is           so still. Oh being alone I call out my           name and once you did and do still in           a way you do call out your name to these states whose way is to walk on by that’s why I write too much At night the states whoever you love that’s who you           love the difference between chaos and           star I believe and in that difference they believed           in some funny way but that wasn’t           what I I believed that out of this           fatigue would be born a light, what is fatigue there is a man whose face           changes continually but I will never, something           I will never with regard to it or           never regard I will regard yours tomorrow I will wear purple will I and call my name At night the states you who are alive, you who are dead when I love you alone all night and           that is what I do until I could never write from your           being enough I don’t want that trick of making           it be coaxed from the words not tonight I want it           coaxed from myself but being not that. But I’d           feel more comfortable about it being words           if it were if that’s what it were for these           are the States where what words are true           are words Not myself. Montana, Illinois.           Escondido.\n	'14':930 'accompani':597 'acknowledg':865 'air':34,654 'aliv':1183 'alon':343,1048,1192 'alreadi':491 'alway':334,341,607,659 'anyon':349 'anyth':795,971 'aren':940 'arm':184 'automat':474 'baltimor':860 'beauti':733,738,758,943 'beg':951 'begin':136 'believ':765,774,1106,1112,1124 'belong':759 'best':326 'blind':906 'book':921 'born':1132 'bring':448 'california':625 'call':960,978,982,988,994,1050,1066,1173 'car':888 'care':531 'chain':224 'chang':1144 'chao':1102 'claustro':250 'clean':438 'clear':836 'climb':638 'coax':1220,1229 'comfort':1241 'consequenti':223 'continu':146,200,432,1145 'contr':147 'could':257,262,634,740,1203 'couldn':933 'cours':120 'd':1238 'danc':253,263 'dare':589,684 'date':816 'dead':567,1187 'dearest':208 'decid':38 'deep':156 'diction':148 'die':1016 'differ':1100,1110 'discov':363 'discurs':100 'doesn':104,234 'done':829,846,849 'drain':317 'dream':94,127 'dri':957 'drum':604,608 'dust':164 'either':679 'empti':880 'end':247 'enough':944,1209 'er':552 'escondido':1271 'everybodi':457 'everyon':66 'explain':970 'eye':294,884,907 'face':1143 'fact':533 'fair':527,656 'fate':286 'fatigu':1129,1137 'feel':176,193,1239 'fieri':466 'figur':368 'find':525 'floor':96 'florida':411 'forget':10 'found':581 'french':915 'ful':130 'funni':1115 'get':645 'go':400,649,780,788 'god':387 'good':713 'happen':311 'hard':749 'hill':641 'histor':285 'home':646,889,899 'honey':68 'illinoi':1270 'inde':540 'indefinit':279 'initi':145 'instead':997 'isn':676 'judgment':519 'june':27 'keep':452 'know':117,483,496,504,506 'let':399,403,406,778 'life':968 'light':76,913,1134 'like':26,33,92,662 'littl':302,307 'live':351 'll':435 'long':417,1014 'longer':99,172 'lose':441,444,615 'lost':554,578,580 'love':138,150,221,365,699,708,1010,1093,1098,1190 'm':745,834 'magick':319 'main':439 'make':967,1217 'man':1141 'matter':206,227,236,288,291 'matter-simpl':290 'may':36 'mayb':67 'mean':123,923 'melodi':303 'mine':995 'mirror':874 'montana':1269 'moon':912 'much':1086 'name':443,619,755,962,980,984,1024,1053,1069,1175 'nesday':370 'never':81,86,845,1149,1153,1159,1204 'night':2,6,30,56,140,195,229,267,345,395,485,510,594,681,782,807,853,926,964,1088,1177,1194 'noth':761,1030 'oh':981,1046 'oldest':163 'one':20,577,583 'opinion':454 'park':428 'part':425,477 'particular':377,797 'passiv':284 'pennsylvania':901 'peopl':390 'perfect':794,851 'perhap':558,722,841 'person':622 'phobic':251 'piec':931 'place':88 'plant':161 'plaqu':216 'pleas':106 'poet':1000 'popular':975 'prais':768 'privat':220 'public':215 'purpl':160,1169 're':87 'real':873 'regard':1155,1160,1163 'remain':335 'rememb':243,637,751,809 'remind':217 'replac':82 'ride':856,886,896 'right':537 'room':460 'rose':825 'sad':629 'said':1029,1033 'sang':1022 'say':73,241,270,374,546,623,651,660,977 'see':258 'seem':690,772 'seen':324,384 'self':584 'shape':918 'sheet':798,805 'shirt':177,179,189 'shut':910 'simpl':289,292 'sing':590,685 'sit':601 'smell':25 'smooth':909 'smuggler':463 'sociat':204 'somehow':777 'someth':375,661,810,830,954,959,1150 'song':976 'sorri':304 'stand':516 'star':23,471,1104 'state':4,8,41,58,142,170,197,231,269,315,347,397,487,512,596,683,710,784,855,904,928,966,1072,1090,1179,1259 'station':902 'still':420,1004,1045,1060 'stoni':908 'street':211 'subway':898 'sweet':32 'sweetest':168 'take':414 'talk':143,468 'tall':643 'tawdri':691 'tell':329 'theori':817 'thing':308,359 'think':70,521,728 'though':539,557,632,721 'thought':49,53,697,800 'time':750,819 'tire':45,64 'told':489,493 'tomorrow':1165 'tonight':1225 'trail':225 'train':858 'tree':644 'tri':863 'trick':1215 'true':1264 'trust':337 'up-to-d':813 've':551,695 'vice':430 'vista':111 'wake':129,132 'walk':465,936,1005,1077 'want':372,1213,1227 'washington':791,891 'wasn':1119 'wast':803 'way':556,617,947,1063,1074,1116 'weapon':475 'wear':1168 'weather':840 'wed':369 'well':831 'wet':958 'whistl':348 'white':824 'whoever':78,1091 'whose':1073,1142 'wind':1020 'window':114 'wish':14,255,260,283,296 'wit':792 'won':613 'word':1223,1245,1262,1266 'world':61 'would':175,333,1130 'wring':953 'write':1084,1205 'yet':451,573,1031
276	Dog Biscuits	132		\nAfter my father’s cremation, my sisters and I agreed to bury him privately when the ground thawed. One will plant a flowering tree, one see to the stone and its cutting, one call the grave digger and the town clerk. It’ll be just us, the daughters, presiding over ashes that could be any mammal’s, or those of any love dispersible by wind. Let’s bury the secret violence to his dogs, Pompey and Tara, Juba and Molly, their ashes already gone to this ground. And his “escapades,” as Mom called them. Here withers that branch of the tree. Let’s bury the ring inscribed In perpetuum ave atque vale (translated “Hail and farewell” by my father, “Hello, and good-bye forever” by Mom, a token dating back to the First Separation) and a tennis ball for canine shades. Your dad is with his dogs now, said more than one person at the funeral. It’ll be just us, the three inheritors, on a raw windy day in Death’s kingdom, lifting our eyes from the hole to the mountains hazed with spring, saying, In perpetuum ave atque vale, minor god of our father.

277	Digging in a Footlocker	133		\nCrouched before dismantled guns, we found war souvenirs our uncle padlocked in the attic, a brittle latch easily pried off. Stiff uniforms on top, snapshots of soldiers young as our cousins, a velvet box of medals as if he fought all battles in World War II. Bayonets, machetes, a folded flag, two hand grenades with missing pins. We picked up teeth like pennies, loose, as if tossed in, a piece of something dark and waxy like a fig, curved like a question mark, a human ear. We touched dried pieces of cloth stuck to curved bones and held them to the light, turning them over and over, wondering how did uncles learn to kill, what would happen when we grew up.\n	'attic':18 'battl':46 'bayonet':51 'bone':100 'box':38 'brittl':20 'cloth':96 'cousin':35 'crouch':5 'curv':83,99 'dark':77 'dig':1 'dismantl':7 'dri':93 'ear':90 'easili':22 'fig':82 'flag':55 'fold':54 'footlock':4 'fought':44 'found':10 'grenad':58 'grew':124 'gun':8 'hand':57 'happen':121 'held':102 'human':89 'ii':50 'kill':118 'latch':21 'learn':116 'light':106 'like':66,80,84 'loos':68 'machet':52 'mark':87 'medal':40 'miss':60 'padlock':15 'penni':67 'pick':63 'piec':74,94 'pin':61 'pri':23 'question':86 'snapshot':29 'soldier':31 'someth':76 'souvenir':12 'stiff':25 'stuck':97 'teeth':65 'top':28 'toss':71 'touch':92 'turn':107 'two':56 'uncl':14,115 'uniform':26 'velvet':37 'war':11,49 'waxi':79 'wonder':112 'world':48 'would':120 'young':32
278	Riding Herd	133		\nBarbed wires on rusted nails can’t hold lone bulls at home when they smell pasture. They thrust their bone skulls under barbs, tongues quivering for a taste of strange and shove until the post gives way. Days later, we find wires sagging, reset the post, and tighten bent wires like a fiddle and rope the worn-out bull, wishing there was only a fence between us and our heart’s desire. But something with spurs and a rope would find us, cursing and yelling on horseback, cutting us from escape down arroyos, dragging us frothing and wild-eyed back to the sun-bleached yellow range, the same whirlpool of buzzards.\n	'arroyo':96 'back':104 'barb':3,25 'bent':51 'bleach':109 'bone':22 'bull':12,62 'buzzard':116 'curs':86 'cut':91 'day':40 'desir':75 'drag':97 'escap':94 'eye':103 'fenc':68 'fiddl':55 'find':43,84 'froth':99 'give':38 'heart':73 'herd':2 'hold':10 'home':14 'horseback':90 'later':41 'like':53 'lone':11 'nail':7 'pastur':18 'post':37,48 'quiver':27 'rang':111 'reset':46 'ride':1 'rope':57,82 'rust':6 'sag':45 'shove':34 'skull':23 'smell':17 'someth':77 'spur':79 'strang':32 'sun':108 'sun-bleach':107 'tast':30 'thrust':20 'tighten':50 'tongu':26 'us':70,85,92,98 'way':39 'whirlpool':114 'wild':102 'wild-ey':101 'wire':4,44,52 'wish':63 'worn':60 'worn-out':59 'would':83 'yell':88 'yellow':110
279	Wac-A-Mole Realism™	134		\nAt the carnival, Robo-Boy sees only things he recognizes. The Ferris Wheel is an overgrown version of his own bells and whistle eyes. His Flashers, his mother calls them. The Tilt-A-Whirl is the angle his head tilts when the Flirt Program goes into effect, usually in the vicinity of a Cindy or a Carrie, though once he found himself tilting at the school librarian which caused him to wheel in reverse into the Civil War section knocking over a cart of books that were waiting to be shelved under B. There’s a dangerously low stratosphere of pink cotton-candy clouds being carried around by the children. If Robo-Boy goes near them, the alarms will go off. It’s the kind of sticky that would cause joint-lock for sure. In a darker, safer corner Robo-Boy finds the Whack-A-Mole game. He pays a dollar and starts whacking the plastic moles on their heads each time they pop up from the much-dented log. He wins bear after bear. It’s only when he's lugging them home, the largest one skidding face-down along the sidewalk getting dirt on its white nose and light blue belly, that he remembers the program: Wac-A-Mole Realism™—the disc on the installer’s desk. Suddenly it all fits together: the way a deliciously strange thought will start wafting out of his unconscious—and then WHAM, it disappears.\n	'alarm':127 'along':205 'angl':44 'around':115 'b':100 'bear':186,188 'bell':27 'belli':217 'blue':216 'book':92 'boy':11,122,152 'call':35 'candi':111 'carniv':8 'carri':64,114 'cart':90 'caus':76,139 'children':118 'cindi':61 'civil':84 'cloud':112 'corner':149 'cotton':110 'cotton-candi':109 'danger':104 'darker':147 'delici':243 'dent':182 'desk':234 'dirt':209 'disappear':257 'disc':229 'dollar':163 'effect':54 'eye':30 'face':203 'face-down':202 'ferri':18 'find':153 'fit':238 'flasher':32 'flirt':50 'found':68 'game':159 'get':208 'go':129 'goe':52,123 'head':46,172 'home':197 'instal':232 'joint':141 'joint-lock':140 'kind':134 'knock':87 'largest':199 'librarian':74 'light':215 'lock':142 'log':183 'low':105 'lug':195 'mole':4,158,169,226 'mother':34 'much':181 'much-dent':180 'near':124 'nose':213 'one':200 'overgrown':22 'pay':161 'pink':108 'plastic':168 'pop':176 'program':51,222 'realism':5,227 'recogn':16 'rememb':220 'revers':81 'robo':10,121,151 'robo-boy':9,120,150 'safer':148 'school':73 'section':86 'see':12 'shelv':98 'sidewalk':207 'skid':201 'start':165,247 'sticki':136 'strang':244 'stratospher':106 'sudden':235 'sure':144 'thing':14 'though':65 'thought':245 'tilt':39,47,70 'tilt-a-whirl':38 'time':174 'togeth':239 'unconsci':252 'usual':55 'version':23 'vicin':58 'wac':2,224 'wac-a-mol':1,223 'waft':248 'wait':95 'war':85 'way':241 'whack':156,166 'whack-a-mol':155 'wham':255 'wheel':19,79 'whirl':41 'whistl':29 'white':212 'win':185 'would':138

The women were more querulous. The first question, a medical subject, was why had the anti-abortionists not mentioned, let alone commented on, the Baboon Heart transplant? One terrified contestant guessed it was because the moral majority’s nervous concern with evolution precluded their bringing it up. That hopeful contestant’s face reflected the malicious light in the eyes of the host who immediately threw the switch A powerful surge shot through the wires and both sexes screamed and writhed, to the delight of the vast viewership, estimated at 100 million, all of whom, presumably, were delighted not to be on the show, because not one in a million knew the answer.\n	'100':131 'abortionist':58 'alon':62 'answer':153 'anti':57 'anti-abortionist':56 'anxious':35 'attach':27 'auspici':16 'baboon':66 'ball':40 'bring':86 'comment':63 'concern':81 'contest':18,71,91 'delight':124,138 'especi':34 'estim':129 'evolut':83 'eye':100 'face':93 'fiddl':23 'first':47 'fortun':9 'guess':72 'heart':67 'hope':90 'host':103 'immedi':105 'kept':22 'knew':151 'let':61 'light':97 'major':78 'malici':96 'medic':50 'men':32 'mention':60 'million':132,150 'moral':77 'nervous':20,80 'one':69,147 'power':110 'preclud':84 'presum':136 'price':2 'privat':30 'querul':45 'question':38,48 'reflect':94 'right':4 'scream':119 'sex':118 'shot':112 'show':11,144 'start':14 'subject':51 'surg':111 'switch':108 'terrifi':70 'threw':106 'tortur':6 'transplant':68 'vast':127 'viewership':128 'wheel':7 'wire':26,115 'women':42 'writh':121
283	Ode on the Facelifting of the "statue" of Liberty	135		\nAmerica is inconceivable without drugs and always has been. One of the first acts was to dump the tea. The drug that furnished the mansions of Virginia was tobacco, a drug now in much disrepute. Sassafras, a cure-all, is what they came for and they dealt it by the bale altho it was only a diaphoretic to make you perspire— people were so simple in those days. The Civil War saw the isolation of morphine making amputation a pleasure and making the block of wood between the teeth, which was no drug, obsolete. Morphinism was soon widespread among doctors and patients. At this date interns, the reports tell us, are among the premier drug ab/users of said moralistic nation. “Rock” stars (who notoriously “have” doctors) consume drugs by the metric ton even as they urge teenagers to Say No. The undercurrent of American history has been the running aches and pains of the worn path to the door of the apothecary to fetch cannabis and cocaine elixirs by the gallon. It has been all prone all seeking Florida, Ponce de León was just the beginning of a statistical curve whose only satisfaction would be total vertigo. His eager search for youth has become our frantic tilt with death and boredom, in fact we are farming death in Florida with far greater profit than we are farming food in Iowa—elixirs are as multiform as the life-style frauds we implore, a cultural patchwork fit for a fool in the only country in the world with a shop called the Drug Store.\n	'ab/users':126 'ach':160 'act':23 'altho':62 'alway':16 'america':10 'american':154 'among':109,122 'amput':88 'apothecari':172 'bale':61 'becom':214 'begin':196 'block':94 'boredom':221 'call':270 'came':53 'cannabi':175 'civil':80 'cocain':177 'consum':137 'countri':263 'cultur':254 'cure':48 'cure-al':47 'curv':200 'date':115 'day':78 'de':191 'dealt':57 'death':219,227 'diaphoret':67 'disreput':44 'doctor':110,136 'door':169 'drug':14,30,40,103,125,138,272 'dump':26 'eager':209 'elixir':178,241 'even':143 'facelift':4 'fact':223 'far':231 'farm':226,237 'fetch':174 'first':22 'fit':256 'florida':189,229 'food':238 'fool':259 'frantic':216 'fraud':250 'furnish':32 'gallon':181 'greater':232 'histori':155 'implor':252 'inconceiv':12 'intern':116 'iowa':240 'isol':84 'león':192 'liberti':9 'life':248 'life-styl':247 'make':69,87,92 'mansion':34 'metric':141 'moralist':129 'morphin':86,105 'much':43 'multiform':244 'nation':130 'notori':134 'obsolet':104 'ode':1 'one':19 'pain':162 'patchwork':255 'path':166 'patient':112 'peopl':72 'perspir':71 'pleasur':90 'ponc':190 'premier':124 'profit':233 'prone':186 'report':118 'rock':131 'run':159 'said':128 'sassafra':45 'satisfact':203 'saw':82 'say':149 'search':210 'seek':188 'shop':269 'simpl':75 'soon':107 'star':132 'statist':199 'statu':7 'store':273 'style':249 'tea':28 'teenag':147 'teeth':99 'tell':119 'tilt':217 'tobacco':38 'ton':142 'total':206 'undercurr':152 'urg':146 'us':120 'vertigo':207 'virginia':36 'war':81 'whose':201 'widespread':108 'without':13 'wood':96 'world':266 'worn':165 'would':204 'youth':212
284	Sweet Tooth	109		\nA little girl made of sugar and spice and everything nice was eaten by someone with a sweet tooth the size of an elephant’s tusk.          Ah, he said, this darn tooth, it’s driving me nuts.          Then another voice is heard. It’s the little girl’s father who says, have you seen a little girl made of sugar and spice and everything nice?--Incidentally, what’s that thing sticking out of your mouth like an elephant’s tusk?          My sweet tooth, and it’s really driving me nuts.          You ought to see a dentist.          But he might want to pull it, and I don’t like people pulling at me. If they want to pull they should pull at their own pullables.          So true, said the little girl’s father, people should pull at their own pullables and let other people's pullables alone.

285	The Academic Sigh	109		\nSome students were stretching a professor on a medieval torture rack. He had offered himself to show them how an academic might be stretched beyond his wildest dreams like a piece of chewing gum.          And as they turned the wheel the professor was getting longer and longer.          Don’t make me too long, or I’ll look kind of goofy, sighed the professor as he grew longer and longer.          Suddenly something snaps.          What happened? sighs the professor from the rack.          We were just stretching an academic when suddenly something snapped; you may have heard it ...          Yes, I was there.

294	The Windy City [sections 1 and 6]	140		\n1 The lean hands of wagon men put out pointing fingers here, picked this crossway, put it on a map,  set up their sawbucks, fixed their shotguns, found a hitching place for the pony express, made a hitching place for the iron horse, the one-eyed horse with the fire-spit head, found a homelike spot and said, “Make a home,”  saw this corner with a mesh of rails, shuttling        people, shunting cars, shaping the junk of        the earth to a new city. The hands of men took hold and tugged And the breaths of men went into the junk And the junk stood up into skyscrapers and asked: Who am I? Am I a city? And if I am what is my name? And once while the time whistles blew and blew again The men answered: Long ago we gave you a name, Long ago we laughed and said: You? Your name is Chicago. Early the red men gave a name to the river,         the place of the skunk,         the river of the wild onion smell,         Shee-caw-go.  Out of the payday songs of steam shovels,  Out of the wages of structural iron rivets,  The living lighted skyscrapers tell it now as a name,  Tell it across miles of sea blue water, gray blue land: I am Chicago, I am a name given out by the breaths of working men,         laughing men, a child, a belonging.  So between the Great Lakes,  The Grand De Tour, and the Grand Prairie,  The living lighted skyscrapers stand, Spotting the blue dusk with checkers of yellow,        streamers of smoke and silver,         parallelograms of night-gray watchmen,  Singing a soft moaning song: I am a child, a belonging.   6 The wheelbarrows grin, the shovels and the mortar        hoist an exploit.  The stone shanks of the Monadnock, the Transportation,         the People’s Gas Building, stand up and scrape        at the sky.  The wheelbarrows sing, the bevels and the blueprints        whisper.  The library building named after Crerar, naked        as a stock farm silo, light as a single eagle        feather, stripped like an airplane propeller,        takes a path up.  Two cool new rivets says, “Maybe it is morning.”        “God knows.” Put the city up; tear the city down;        put it up again; let us find a city. Let us remember the little violet-eyed        man who gave all, praying, “Dig and        dream, dream and hammer, till your        city comes.” Every day the people sleep and the city dies;        every day the people shake loose, awake and        build the city again. The city is a tool chest opened every day,        a time clock punched every morning,        a shop door, bunkers and overalls        counting every day. The city is a balloon and a bubble plaything        shot to the sky every evening, whistled in        a ragtime jig down the sunset. The city is made, forgotten, and made again,        trucks hauling it away haul it back        steered by drivers whistling ragtime        against the sunsets. Every day the people get up and carry the city,        carry the bunkers and balloons of the city,        lift it and put it down.                “I will die as many times                as you make me over again,                says the city to the people, I am the woman, the home, the family, I get breakfast and pay the rent; I telephone the doctor, the milkman, the undertaker;        I fix the streets        for your first and your last ride— Come clean with me, come clean or dirty, I am stone and steel of your sleeping numbers;        I remember all you forget.        I will die as many times        as you make me over again.” Under the foundations,  Over the roofs,  The bevels and the blueprints talk it over.

296	The Caveman on the Train	141		\nWhen first the apprizing eye and tongue that muttered (Banished from Eden’s air? Or pride of apes?) Sat clinking flint on flint, as they shattered Snatched with a grin what fell in craftier shapes, The law was move or die. Lively from tigers; Dainty on deer. As weather called the tune. Oxen, we learned, would bear us. So would rivers. And that was science. On the whole a boon. What caveman on a round rock dumped a-grunting Rubbed at a rueful hip, brow darkening why? Or gaped at boulders over gravel shifting Until—a splendor of wheel-thought like sunrise! No wonder: such example in a heaven Revving immaculate gears, and at his feet The planet on her axle greased and even. Put any wheel to earth, and two wheels meet. Athens cut ruts of marble; ivory courses Caromed Apollo’s car of talkative gold.  And Donne saw wagon-ways. The horsepower: horse Over the flats of Kansas sail-cars rolled.  First planks on querulous ground, then treads of met Steel set edgewise, over stone for ties.  A mountain? Sawtooth rail or crank-and-cable Till iron took serene the incredulous rise.

299	Day Room	104		\nHis head rose like a torch in a tomb. Banquet-style, as at a second Symposium, The others lounged on couches or lay knocked out. A net of shadows dangled from wire-meshed windows. Buffeted there, there, some swam against currents Or were swept off into underwater canyons. Visitors, confusion streaming over them, speech Foaming into eddies, words lolling like jetsam On the lightless bottom, listened to the news Of minds crammed in bodies: Here, all was stoic Or hectic or unspeaking disconnection. Moving shadows on the TV screen implied A world out there, though a world more couth, More uncouth? in four o’clock’s slushy freezing dark: Plato’s cave loomed in semblance of the walls, Only wasn’t it the cave as All, no outside Not inside, nothing more real to go out into? He peered far down to where dark swam up From the depthless screen and hovered poised Above dark-in-light: Sergeant Schultz kept repeating, “I know nothing, nothing,” his funny-Nazi German accent As he recoils from his ever sauve tormentor, the American POW Colonel Hogan who threatens Schultz With good-humored ruthlessness as bad as a mother In a supermarket aisle cajoling her greedy-eyed child, “Ah ah ah—remember the Russian front!” —Poor Schultz’s accent making him more human in his terror, Though only an actor acting his lines through The canned laughter’s bacchic furor sweeping down The corridor to die in murmurs of slippers shushing. Cast yourself in it, imagine having to say those lines, Not just now, but always, eternity a chaos Of laugh-track frenzy more demonic than funny, Reruns of Hogan haunted by the actor Who acts Hogan’s lines, his real-life orgies Before a secret camera ending in his Glogotha, His infamy to be bludgeoned and found wrapped Naked in a shower curtain that hangs In the mind like the cave’s walls turning outside Inside outside inside no end or difference inside out —The almost see-through membrane of a world gone flat: He hunches forward to change the channel. Muttering something to Schultz’s “I know nothing, nothing,” A grim joke maybe, “Ain’t that the truth...” though really, Who could know what words he was or wasn’t Answering, who can hear above the roar of Earth moving under him, trying to throw him off As he clings to the sofa hurtling through space! And as he clings, the screen slowly opens and fans out wide Around the National Broadcasting Corporation peacock Waving its plumes, flaming blues, greens, radiant vermilions, Brilliance of the seasons, late-morning pastels Easy and restful for the brain and eye, Sempiternal hues Atlantis rose up and sank back into. And these feather off into grays, solid wintry Grays that give off nothing and reflect nothing back.\n	'accent':176,223 'act':235,291 'actor':234,289 'ah':213,214,215 'ain':373 'aisl':206 'almost':343 'alway':270 'american':186 'answer':390 'around':428 'atlanti':460 'bacchic':243 'back':465,483 'bad':199 'banquet':13 'banquet-styl':12 'bludgeon':312 'blue':438 'bodi':78 'bottom':69 'brain':455 'brillianc':442 'broadcast':431 'buffet':39 'cajol':207 'camera':303 'can':240 'canyon':52 'cast':256 'cave':116,128,328 'chang':357 'channel':359 'chao':273 'child':212 'cling':409,419 'clock':109 'colonel':188 'confus':54 'corpor':432 'corridor':248 'couch':24 'could':381 'couth':103 'cram':76 'current':45 'curtain':320 'dangl':33 'dark':113,148,160 'dark-in-light':159 'day':1 'demon':280 'depthless':153 'die':250 'differ':339 'disconnect':87 'earth':398 'easi':450 'eddi':61 'end':304,337 'etern':271 'ever':182 'eye':211,457 'fan':425 'far':144 'feather':469 'flame':437 'flat':352 'foam':59 'forward':355 'found':314 'four':107 'freez':112 'frenzi':278 'front':219 'funni':173,282 'funny-nazi':172 'furor':244 'german':175 'give':477 'glogotha':307 'go':139 'gone':351 'good':195 'good-humor':194 'gray':472,475 'greedi':210 'greedy-ey':209 'green':439 'grim':370 'hang':322 'haunt':286 'head':4 'hear':393 'hectic':84 'hogan':189,285,292 'hover':156 'hue':459 'human':227 'humor':196 'hunch':354 'hurtl':413 'imagin':260 'impli':94 'infami':309 'insid':134,333,335,340 'jetsam':65 'joke':371 'kept':165 'knock':27 'know':168,366,382 'late':447 'late-morn':446 'laugh':276 'laugh-track':275 'laughter':241 'lay':26 'life':298 'light':162 'lightless':68 'like':6,64,326 'line':237,265,294 'listen':70 'loll':63 'loom':117 'loung':22 'make':224 'mayb':372 'membran':347 'mesh':37 'mind':75,325 'morn':448 'mother':202 'move':88,399 'murmur':252 'mutter':360 'nake':316 'nation':430 'nazi':174 'net':30 'news':73 'noth':135,169,170,367,368,479,482 'o':108 'open':423 'orgi':299 'other':21 'outsid':132,332,334 'pastel':449 'peacock':433 'peer':143 'plato':114 'plume':436 'pois':157 'poor':220 'pow':187 'radiant':440 'real':137,297 'real-lif':296 'realli':379 'recoil':179 'reflect':481 'rememb':216 'repeat':166 'rerun':283 'rest':452 'roar':396 'room':2 'rose':5,461 'russian':218 'ruthless':197 'sank':464 'sauv':183 'say':263 'schultz':164,192,221,363 'screen':93,154,421 'season':445 'second':18 'secret':302 'see':345 'see-through':344 'semblanc':119 'sempitern':458 'sergeant':163 'shadow':32,89 'shower':319 'shush':255 'slipper':254 'slowli':422 'slushi':111 'sofa':412 'solid':473 'someth':361 'space':415 'speech':58 'stoic':82 'stream':55 'style':14 'supermarket':205 'swam':43,149 'sweep':245 'swept':48 'symposium':19 'terror':230 'though':99,231,378 'threaten':191 'throw':404 'tomb':11 'torch':8 'tormentor':184 'track':277 'tri':402 'truth':377 'turn':331 'tv':92 'uncouth':105 'underwat':51 'unspeak':86 'vermilion':441 'visitor':53 'wall':122,330 'wasn':124,388 'wave':434 'wide':427 'window':38 'wintri':474 'wire':36 'wire-mesh':35 'word':62,384 'world':96,101,350 'wrap':315
300	On the Yard	104		\nAfter lockdown, tier by tier undresses to sleep: Each skull nestles in its mattress-hollow. Wall facing wall inside of wall shrinks to a keyhole: A fly creeps through and starts to buzz, reeling through bars Down steel corridors. A dreamer’s eye follows the fly, And wherever the fly lands, the eye touches down With an airier Midas touch that turns all to glass: The eye wakes to Bentham’s panopticon, glazed cage Of an inspection house where only the Warden sees all. —I am asleep and not asleep, I stare up into faces swarming: Cellblocks of memory focus face by face, Mine flitting in and out of theirs: In prison issue They come, footsteps mingling over mine in a child’s game Of chase from yard to cell, only we’re all grown men, Meatier, less and more malign than A boy’s imagining himself grown... —I was asleep and not asleep, Faces came and went. Frank the Joker, the West Virginia biker, who composed “A rhyme to fit the crime”: “There was a young fellow named Frank Who gave his girlfriend a spank; She fell in a heap In front of Frank’s jeep And old Frank ran her down for a prank.” Or the white-haired lifer, densley oracular: “Sometimes, after lockdown, your thoughts Just don’t have the energy to climb the wall.” The Giggler who bolted His brother in a barn and burned it down, Eyes challenging, sly: “They killed this guy and see, I think this is funny, hilarious In fact, but you, you won’t think so—they cut off his dick And shoved it in his mouth.” Or the child molester who said about flowers At funerals: “They’re there, aren’t they, To hide the stink off the corpse?” Or Pat, armed robber Who held aloof: Rolled shirtsleeves, forearms Carved from basalt, smoke rings Lazily effusing: “The johns here, they got no doors: You ever try to take a shit while someone’s watching? It took six months to get used to that— But here, man, the bars feed on Time, they nibble It to nothing.” —I wanted to sleep and couldn’t sleep, I stared up into faces swarming. Three o’clock dark dissolves The walls, faces start to drift, their atoms Mix with concrete’s Atomic swirl, bodies get stuck Floating halfway through, heartbeats Booming as through a stethoscope: Like Michaelangelo’s slaves, if a fly Landed on their noses, They couldn’t lift a hand to brush it off. Dark velleities buzz in this hive of steel Where power handshakes Flower in forests Of interlocking fingers: In red prison uniform, a man On death row, convicted 1984, exonerated and pardoned October 2000 (New York Times, Dec. 10): “You could hear the humming of the chair Every time they cut it on, like an air-conditioner Cutting on. My daddy came to see me, he said, ‘What's that?’ I said, ‘The chair.’ The way they put it, they got to test the chair.” —I was asleep And couldn’t wake up. Inside my skull, glass Keeps shattering: Dream-beings Unsubscribed to the will, with insect bodies And human heads, dash against walls, mammal softness Of cheeks and lips join with stingers Pulsing...my eyes awake and not awake, where is the chamber As in the horror movie Return of the Fly that, circuitry and test-tubes Sparking, would unscramble these divided Natures? (They called me “Teach” As in “Hey, Teach, how do you spell...” When I confessed I’d been in jail, they looked disappointed in me: Their side of the wall was theirs, not mine.) —I tried to turn over, to look away, But couldn’t wake up, couldn’t not wake. Chemicals drip into a man’s veins, one each For heart, lungs, brain. Strapped to a table, he stares Impassive, eyes flickering shut, body A meat wall, IV tubes Almost empty... —I was asleep and not asleep, I couldn’t move to wake. I hear shrill wings—that fly inspecting bread crumbs Under dining hall tables while the Warden blares Descartes over the Intercom: “If a man’s head were lopped off His mouth would keep on moving, faultlessly Justifying his crimes.” But that fly, that speck against Steel, its wings steered in ways that seem crazy To eyes awake, not awake, Not seeing, all-seeing, the head unmoving Moving to turn away...oh seely fly I can’t not see, can’t move to brush away From my unsleeping eyes, you veer In spirals unflattened into pathos Of careening chaos, your eccentric Flight path darts Through bars, oh alas, hairy Vibrant fly!\n	'10':465 '1984':455 '2000':460 'air':483 'air-condition':482 'airier':62 'ala':785 'all-se':739 'almost':664 'aloof':311 'aren':295 'arm':307 'asleep':91,94,155,158,515,668,671 'atom':388,393 'awak':555,558,734,736 'away':625,748,762 'bar':40,353,783 'barn':242 'basalt':317 'be':529 'bentham':74 'biker':169 'blare':694 'bodi':395,536,658 'bolt':237 'boom':402 'boy':148 'brain':647 'bread':685 'brother':239 'brush':425,761 'burn':244 'buzz':37,430 'cage':78 'call':585 'came':160,489 'careen':775 'carv':315 'cell':134 'cellblock':101 'chair':473,501,512 'challeng':248 'chamber':562 'chao':776 'chase':130 'cheek':546 'chemic':635 'child':126,284 'circuitri':573 'climb':231 'clock':378 'come':119 'compos':171 'concret':391 'condition':484 'confess':598 'convict':454 'corps':304 'corridor':43 'could':467 'couldn':367,419,517,627,631,673 'crazi':731 'creep':32 'crime':177,716 'crumb':686 'cut':272,477,485 'd':600 'daddi':488 'dark':379,428 'dart':781 'dash':540 'death':452 'dec':464 'densley':217 'descart':695 'dick':275 'dine':688 'disappoint':606 'dissolv':380 'divid':582 'door':328 'dream':528 'dream-b':527 'dreamer':45 'drift':386 'drip':636 'eccentr':778 'effus':321 'empti':665 'energi':229 'ever':330 'everi':474 'exoner':456 'eye':47,57,71,247,554,655,733,766 'face':21,99,105,107,159,374,383 'fact':263 'faultless':713 'feed':354 'fell':192 'fellow':182 'finger':444 'fit':175 'fli':31,50,54,413,571,683,719,751,788 'flicker':656 'flight':779 'flit':109 'float':398 'flower':289,439 'focus':104 'follow':48 'footstep':120 'forearm':314 'forest':441 'frank':163,184,199,204 'front':197 'funer':291 'funni':260 'game':128 'gave':186 'get':345,396 'giggler':235 'girlfriend':188 'glass':69,524 'glaze':77 'got':326,508 'grown':139,152 'guy':253 'hair':215 'hairi':786 'halfway':399 'hall':689 'hand':423 'handshak':438 'head':539,703,743 'heap':195 'hear':468,679 'heart':645 'heartbeat':401 'held':310 'hey':590 'hide':299 'hilari':261 'hive':433 'hollow':19 'horror':566 'hous':82 'hum':470 'human':538 'imagin':150 'impass':654 'insect':535 'insid':23,521 'inspect':81,684 'intercom':698 'interlock':443 'issu':117 'iv':662 'jail':603 'jeep':201 'john':323 'join':549 'joker':165 'justifi':714 'keep':525,710 'keyhol':29 'kill':251 'land':55,414 'lazili':320 'less':142 'lifer':216 'lift':421 'like':407,480 'lip':548 'lockdown':5,221 'look':605,624 'lop':705 'lung':646 'malign':145 'mammal':543 'man':351,450,639,701 'mattress':18 'mattress-hollow':17 'meat':660 'meatier':141 'memori':103 'men':140 'michaelangelo':408 'mida':63 'mine':108,123,617 'mingl':121 'mix':389 'molest':285 'month':343 'mouth':281,708 'move':675,712,745,759 'movi':567 'name':183 'natur':583 'nestl':14 'new':461 'nibbl':358 'nose':417 'noth':361 'o':377 'octob':459 'oh':749,784 'old':203 'one':642 'oracular':218 'panopticon':76 'pardon':458 'pat':306 'path':780 'patho':773 'power':437 'prank':210 'prison':116,447 'puls':552 'put':505 'ran':205 're':137,293 'red':446 'reel':38 'return':568 'rhyme':173 'ring':319 'robber':308 'roll':312 'row':453 'said':287,494,499 'see':87,255,491,738,741,756 'seeli':750 'seem':730 'shatter':526 'shirtsleev':313 'shit':335 'shove':277 'shrill':680 'shrink':26 'shut':657 'side':610 'six':342 'skull':13,523 'slave':410 'sleep':11,365,369 'sli':249 'smoke':318 'soft':544 'someon':337 'sometim':219 'spank':190 'spark':578 'speck':721 'spell':595 'spiral':770 'stare':96,371,653 'start':35,384 'steel':42,435,723 'steer':726 'stethoscop':406 'stinger':551 'stink':301 'strap':648 'stuck':397 'swarm':100,375 'swirl':394 'tabl':651,690 'take':333 'teach':587,591 'test':510,576 'test-tub':575 'think':257,269 'thought':223 'three':376 'tier':6,8 'time':356,463,475 'took':341 'touch':58,64 'tri':331,619 'tube':577,663 'turn':66,621,747 'undress':9 'unflatten':771 'uniform':448 'unmov':744 'unscrambl':580 'unsleep':765 'unsubscrib':530 'use':346 'veer':768 'vein':641 'velleiti':429 'vibrant':787 'virginia':168 'wake':72,519,629,634,677 'wall':20,22,25,233,382,542,613,661 'want':363 'warden':86,693 'watch':339 'way':503,728 'went':162 'west':167 'wherev':52 'white':214 'white-hair':213 'wing':681,725 'won':267 'would':579,709 'yard':3,132 'york':462 'young':181
301	New York American Spell, 2001	104		\nI / omen What was going on in the New York American Black/red/green helmeted neon night? The elevator door was closing behind us, we were the ones Plunging floor after floor after floor after floor   To the abyss—but it was someone else’s face Staring from the screen out at us, someone else’s face Saying something flashing from the teleprompter: Though what the face said was meant to reassure, Down in the abyss the footage kept playing, All of it looping back like children chanting The answers to nonsensical riddles, taunting A classmate who doesn’t know the question: “Because it’s too far to walk” “Time to get a new fence” “A big red rock eater.” And as the images rewound And the face kept talking, the clear night sky Filled up with smoke and the smoke kept puring Itself out into the air like a voice saying something It can’t stop saying, some murky omen Like schoolkids asking: “Why do birds fly south?” “What time is it when an elephant sits on the fence?” “What’s big, red and eats rocks?”     2 / in front of st. vincent’s A woman hugging another woman Who was weeping blocked the sidewalk. Nobody moved for a moment. They were an island caught at the tide turning: Such misery in two human bodies. Then the wearing away of the crowd Moving flowed over them and they   Were pulled swiftly along down the sidewalk.     3 / joke Faces powdered with dust and ash, there they were In the fast food place, raucous and wild, splitting The seams of their work clothes, weary to hysteria As they hunched in their booth next to the buffet Under heat lamps reflecting incarnadine Off pastas and vegetable slag. Then the joke Ignited, they quivered on the launch pad, Laughter closed around them, they couldn’t Breathe, it was as if they were staring out From a space capsule porthole and were asking The void an imponderable riddle While orbiting so high up in space That the earth was less than the least hint Of light piercing the smoke-filled, cloudless night. (What was the joke about? Nobody knew.) And then they stopped laughing and stared into their plates, Ash smearing down their faces as they chewed.     4 / spell spoken by suppliant to helios for knowledge                          from the Greek Magical Papyri Under my tongue is the mud of the Nile, I wear the baboon hide of sacred Keph. Dressed in the god’s power, I am the god, I am Thouth, discoverer of healing drugs, Founder of letters. As god calls on god I summon you to come to me, you Under the earth; arouse yourself for me, Great daimon, you the subterranean, You of the primordial abyss. Unless you tell me what I want to know, What is in the minds of everyone, Egyptians, Greeks, Syrians, Ethiopians, of every race And people, unless I know what has been And what shall be, unless I know their skills And practices and works and lives and names Of them and their fathers and mothers And brothers and friends, even of those now dead, I will pour the blood of the black-faced jackal As an offering in a new-made jar and put it In the fire and burn beneath it what’s left Of the bones of all-praised Osiris, And I will shout in the port of Busiris The secrets of his mysteries, that his body, Drowned, remained in the river three days And three nights, that he, the praised one, Was carried by the river into the sea And surrounded by wave on wave on wave And by mist rising off water through the air. To keep your belly from being eaten by fish, To keep the fish from chewing your flesh with their mouths, To make the fish close their hungry jaws, to keep The fatherless child from being taken From his mother, to keep the pole of the sky From being brought down and the twin towering Mountains from toppling into one, to keep Anoixis From running amok and doing just what she wants, Not god or goddess will give oracles Until I know through and through Just what is in the minds of all human beings, Egyptians, Syrians, Greeks, Ethyopians, of every race And people, so that those who come to me. Their eyes and mine can meet in a level gaze, Neither one or the other higher or lower, And whether they speak or keep silent, I can tell them whatever has happened And is happening and is going to happen To them, and I can tell them their skills And their works and their names and those of their dead, And of every human being who comes to me I will read them as I read a sealed letter And tell them everything truthfully.     5 / from brooklyn bridge Sun shines on the third bridge tower: A garbage scow ploughs the water, Maternal hull pushing is all out beyond The city, pushing it all out so patiently— All you could hear out there this flawless afternoon Is the sound of sand pulverizing newsprint To tatters, paper-pulp ripping crosswise Or lengthwise, shearing off some photo Of maybe a head or maybe an arm. Ridiculous flimsy noble newspaper, Leaping in wind, fluttering, collapsing, Its columns sway and topple into babble: All you’d see if you were out there Is air vanishing into clearer air.     6 / from the plane Pressed against our seats, them released to air, From the little plane windows we peered four thousand feet Down to the ground desert-gray and still, Nothing seeming to be moving on that perfect afternoon, No reminder of why it was we were all looking, Remembering maybe the oh so flimsy Wooden sawhorse police barricades, as the woman In front of me twisted her head back to see It all again, but up there there was nothing to see, Only the reef water feel of transparency Deepening down to a depth where everything Goes dark and nothing moves unless it belongs To that dark, darting in and out or undulating Slowly or cruising unblinking, jaws open or closed.     7 / spell broken by suppliant to helios for protection                    from the Greek Magical Papyri This is the charm that will protect you, the charm That you must wear: Onto lime wood write With vermilion the secret name, name of The fifty magic letters. Then say the words: “Guard me from every daimon of the air, On the earth and under the earth, guard me From every angel and phantom, every Ghostly visitation and enchantment, Me, your suppliant.” Enclose it in a skin Dyed purple, hang it round your neck and wear it.     8 / roll of film: photographer missing Vines of smoke through latticework of steel Weave the air into a garden of smoke. And in the garden people came and went, People of smoke and people of flesh, the air dressed In ash. What the pictures couldn’t say Was spoken by the smoke: A common language In a tongue of smoke that murmured in every ear Something about what it was they’d been forced To endure: Words spoken in duress, Inconsolable words, words spoken under the earth That rooted in smoke and breathed in the smoke And put forth shoots that twined through the steel, Words plunged through the roof of the garages’ Voids, I-beams twisted; the eye that saw all this Tells and tells again one part of the story Of that day of wandering through the fatal garden, The camera’s eye open and acutely Recording in the foul-smelling air.     9 / lamentation on ur                                from a Sumerian spell, 2000 B.C. Like molten bronze and iron shed blood           pools. Our country’s dead melt into the earth           as grease melts in the sun, men whose helmets now lie scattered, men annihilated by the double-bladed axe. Heavy, beyond           help, they lie still as a gazelle exhausted in a trap,           muzzle in the dust. In home after home, empty doorways frame the absence of mothers and fathers who vanished           in the flames remorselessly spreading claiming even           frightened children who lay quiet in their mother’s arms, now borne into oblivion, like swimmers swept out to sea           by the surging current. May the great barred gate           of blackest night again swing shut on silent hinges. Destroyed in its turn, may this disaster too be torn out of mind.\n	'2':191 '2000':1303 '2001':5 '3':249 '4':387 '5':824 '6':924 '7':1047 '8':1139 '9':1295 'absenc':1366 'abyss':42,79,467 'acut':1287

303	Reservation	143		\nThis prairie holds us with its plainness. An ugly wife. We would not stay but children comfort us and we need this flatness. On our table a carp with a tumor on its lip, larva eating its side. An old man laughs, one silver tooth in his head like a galvanized watertank.

The eight o five carrying g(rain) sings like tribes when they migrated north in summer across the plains following tracks of herds. High water into trees. The lake full of rain. We say it is someone else pushing down on the lake to make it spill over its edge. While we wait the woman earth sings with the tribes, transforms herself into all things. After the train b(rush) burning, the delay of smoke in the car comes after we have passed like sound. Rain hangs fringe from earth woman’s dress.

306	Reservation School for Girls	143		\nI. We hang clothes on the line. His wide trousers and shirt, wind-beat, roar small thunder from one prairie cloud. The same rapple of flag on its pole. Half in fear, half in jest, we laugh. He calls us crow women. Our black hair shines in the sun and in the light from school windows. He drives his car to town, upsets the dust on buckboard hills. We sit on the fence when he is gone. Does he know we speak of thunder in his shirts? We cannot do well in his school. He reads from west to east, The sun we follow moves the other way. Crowbar. Our eyes come loose from words on the page in narrow rooms of the reservation school. He perceives and deciphers at once. For us written letters will not stay on the page, but fall like crows from the sky and hit against the glass windows of the school. Our day is night when we sit in rows of the classroom. Leaves in a whirlwind from sumac groves. Flock of crows are black starts on a white night. II. On the porch of the reservation school the blackbirds walk around our feet, fly into our head. They call our secret name. Dark corridors linger in our mind We whisper the plains to one another. We do not talk of what we cannot understand. Black and white fleckered dresses. Our face like our fathers. The sun is no enemy to the eye looking west. The brush thin as hair of old ones. It blinds the eye, makes fire on fields, flashes against windows like silver ribbons on burial robes. Hot late into the fall, windy, ready for cold to sweep in. The heat seems solid, but totters on the brink of winter. We laugh to ourselves when he returns to the reservation school for girls. Take his clothes from the line. Set the table with salt and pepper, spoon, knives. Cattails and milk-pods in a jar. We get lard from the basement, rub a place in the dusty window like a moon in the ancient sky. III. One hill larger than the others: an old buffalo with heavy head and whiskers nods at the ground, grazes in my dreams, one blade at a time. We stay in our stiff white-sheeted beds in the dormitory room. Buffalo wander in our dreams. White night-dresses. Black pods suspended in sumac groves like crows. In the sweat lodge of sleep we make our vision quest, black as pitch in crevice between crow feathers. We hang his thunder clothes in sleep, arms reach above our beds like willows blowing slowly by the creek. Quietly we choke, hold our wounded arms like papooses. Clothes beat on lines. Sumac groves and whirl of leaves: a shadow of our fathers at council fires. Red leaves, waxy as hay on fields. We dream of schoolrooms. Written letters on the wind. He reads crow-marks on the page but does not know crow.\n	'ancient':359 'anoth':227 'arm':445,463 'around':203 'basement':346 'beat':19,467 'bed':397,449 'black':49,186,237,411,430 'blackbird':201 'blade':385 'blind':266 'blow':452 'brink':302 'brush':258 'buckboard':72 'buffalo':370,402 'burial':280 'call':44,211 'cannot':94,235 'car':65 'cattail':333 'choke':459 'classroom':174 'cloth':8,320,442,466 'cloud':26 'cold':290 'come':117 'corridor':216 'council':482 'creek':456 'crevic':434 'crow':46,150,184,418,436,503,512 'crow-mark':502 'crowbar':114 'dark':215 'day':164 'deciph':134 'dormitori':400 'dream':383,406,492 'dress':241,410 'drive':63 'dust':70 'dusti':352 'east':105 'enemi':251 'eye':116,254,268 'face':243 'fall':148,286 'father':246,480 'fear':37 'feather':437 'feet':205 'fenc':78 'field':272,490 'fire':270,483 'flag':31 'flash':273 'flecker':240 'fli':206 'flock':182 'follow':109 'get':342 'girl':4,317 'glass':158 'gone':82 'graze':380 'ground':379 'grove':181,416,471 'hair':50,261 'half':35,38 'hang':7,439 'hay':488 'head':209,373 'heat':295 'heavi':372 'hill':73,363 'hit':155 'hold':460 'hot':282 'ii':192 'iii':361 'jar':340 'jest':40 'knive':332 'know':85,511 'lard':343 'larger':364 'late':283 'laugh':42,306 'leav':175,475,485 'letter':140,496 'light':58 'like':149,244,276,354,417,450,464 'line':11,323,469 'linger':217 'lodg':422 'look':255 'loos':118 'make':269,426 'mark':504 'milk':336 'milk-pod':335 'mind':220 'moon':356 'move':110 'name':214 'narrow':125 'night':166,191,409 'night-dress':408 'nod':376 'old':263,369 'one':24,226,264,362,384 'other':367 'page':123,146,507 'papoos':465 'pepper':330 'perceiv':132 'pitch':432 'place':349 'plain':224 'pod':337,412 'pole':34 'porch':195 'prairi':25 'quest':429 'quiet':457 'rappl':29 'reach':446 'read':101,501 'readi':288 'red':484 'reserv':1,129,198,314 'return':311 'ribbon':278 'roar':20 'robe':281 'room':126,401 'row':171 'rub':347 'salt':328 'school':2,60,99,130,162,199,315 'schoolroom':494 'secret':213 'seem':296 'set':324 'shadow':477 'sheet':396 'shine':51 'shirt':16,92 'silver':277 'sit':75,169 'sky':153,360 'sleep':424,444 'slowli':453 'small':21 'solid':297 'speak':87 'spoon':331 'start':187 'stay':143,390 'stiff':393 'sumac':180,415,470 'sun':54,107,248 'suspend':413 'sweat':421 'sweep':292 'tabl':326 'take':318 'talk':231 'thin':259 'thunder':22,89,441 'time':388 'totter':299 'town':67 'trouser':14 'understand':236 'upset':68 'us':45,138 'vision':428 'walk':202 'wander':403 'waxi':486 'way':113 'well':96 'west':103,256 'whirl':473 'whirlwind':178 'whisker':375 'whisper':222 'white':190,239,395,407 'white-sheet':394 'wide':13 'willow':451 'wind':18,499 'wind-beat':17 'windi':287 'window':61,159,275,353 'winter':304 'women':47 'word':120 'wound':462 'written':139,495
307	Weighing Light	144		\nOften the slightest gesture is most telling,As when he reaches tenderly in passing To pluck the yellow leaf from the dark fall Of her hair, or even the absence of all gesture: The way she doesn’t need to turn to know Who, in this gathering of friends, has touched her. It was as if he dreamed some private garden. Perhaps he woke from it, mid-reach, to find His hand too near her hair in this crowded yard, And maybe even now she’s shuttering in (She’s even better than you or I at that) A storm of worry and recrimination— Did anyone notice? how could he do that here!— By seamlessly continuing to tell you About her trip to see her favorite Vermeer This morning in the Delft show at the Met: “So now they say she isn’t weighing pearls Or gold or anything—it’s just the light Gleaming off empty scales.” So much is hard To know for sure. If I confronted her, She’d say it was just a leaf—who could afford To disagree? Could we? Now she’s explaining How the girl faces a mirror we can’t see into And how behind her hangs a gloomy painting Of the Last Judgment: “Over her head God Floats in a cloud,” she says, “like a thought balloon.”   But you don’t hear.

There’s a persimmon tree, with its thin covering of leaves and its branches weighed by tightly packed, hard orange orbs, dense and  ripening, and a thicket of rosemary sprawling about in the autumn sun, gone wild, looking like it might take over the world with its thick rough tines, the heavy scent that rubs off onto skin and lasts all day even after you wake. But thinking of that town my friends have gone on to, looking out the window at the summer light, the raging open blue of the sky outside, I cross past the old shed to where the harrowed ground forms the first hint of a path between the cherry trees lining the field, to where a pair of jackdaws come in from the north, creamy white throats quiet as the flat slate sky above, flit  between some memory of spring, the one gone or the one up ahead.\n	'ahead':112,307 'autumn':188 'bed':88 'beyond':118 'blue':243 'branch':168 'busi':19 'cake':140 'call':24,51 'catch':22 'cherri':268 'collect':130 'come':76,279 'cover':163 'creami':284 'cross':249 'day':80,216 'dens':176 'discard':132 'edg':124 'empti':153 'end':85 'even':217 'feedbag':154 'field':7,127,272 'first':261 'flat':290 'flit':294 'form':259 'friend':4,227 'furrow':149 'gone':107,190,229,302 'ground':15,258 'hard':173 'harrow':257 'heavi':206 'hint':262 'hoe':134 'hold':28 'jackdaw':278 'last':48,214 'leav':165 'lie':109 'light':75,239 'like':193 'line':270 'loam':142 'long':11 'look':65,192,232 'm':18 'memori':297 'might':54,195 'mind':94 'moment':31 'morn':73 'name':58,100 'north':283 'old':120,146,252 'one':301,305 'onto':211 'open':242 'orang':174 'orb':175 'outsid':247 'pack':172 'pair':276 'past':250 'path':265 'perhap':108 'persimmon':158 'pick':136 'plough':150 'quiet':287 'rage':241 'reach':95 'realiz':46 'ripen':178 'rosemari':183 'rough':203 'rub':209 'run':10 'scent':207 'shadow':9 'shed':121,253 'sheet':81 'shovel':138 'skin':212 'sky':246,292 'slate':291 'soil':144 'sprawl':184 'spring':299 'still':139 'strewn':82 'summer':72,238 'sun':189 'take':196 'thick':202 'thicket':181 'thin':162 'thing':49 'think':222 'thought':104 'throat':286 'tight':171 'time':92 'tine':204 'tool':133 'town':61,117,225 'tree':159,269 'tri':20 'two':148 'two-furrow':147 'unfamiliar':34 'until':14 'urgent':78 'voic':33 'wake':44,220 'weigh':169 'white':285 'wild':191 'window':235 'word':37,102 'world':199

330	Sheep, Golden Syrup, Elizabeth Bishop	160		\nDo not a civilization make. Do they? Cozy up to the fleece of a sheep, take the lid off Elizabeth Bishop’s head and get a spoon. Do not eat yet; do not swoon. There will be hours for that. First there is a long war march. Then there are other animals to press into the barn before the lightning storm comes to cook the grass and rinse it and make a mess. But this is all outside and you need never go there. Can you ride a tin? Yes, you can, says the child detective. The poet lies under the sheep, reading of Robert Menzies, his wife Pattie, and their pets. “We had a lovely weekend,” they tell reporters. Just months later their cat’s dead. Robert turns from the golden syrup, while deciding whether to use a knife or a spoon, the television on though it’s only 8 am. Elizabeth was reading her poetry aloud into a woolly microphone. She thought she saw the top of Robert’s head pass by the window.\r\n \r\n\r\n\nShe was thinking of the story “Marmosets” she was translating, by Clarice Lispector. A spirit moved out of the shadows and found an unopened tin in the cupboard and threw it at the window, causing the monkeys on the verandah to flee from the glass. You can hear it on the recording at PennSound. A shearer found glass in a sheep’s fleece months later. “Lucky.” “Why lucky?” “Lucky it didn’t take your thumb off.” That was what Bishop heard about it. She wanted something to give to Clarice. Something in wool or a painting. She saw the earth tipping up, as if she was falling over while looking out the window, and she was traveling to Australia via a flying tin of golden syrup, where there were sheep all ready to cushion her, but it wasn’t necessary for she fell into the arms of the Prime Minister. “Tilted space age pastoral,” she thought, but “marmoset” was what she murmured up at him. He could hear his wife crying that their cat was dead. “It was bloody ASIO!” she bawled. Saying sorry, he dropped the unexpected visitor on the lawn and went to his wife’s aid. He spread one of the scones he’d baked earlier and made a fresh pot. “I don’t want any of that ASIO muck,” Pattie grizzled. Robert turned to Elizabeth to see if she could hear, ready to explain how upset his wife was. Elizabeth had found a curious black spread in the cupboard and was helping herself. “That’s not food,” baa’d the sheep detective. Lightning struck where they’d been sitting just minutes before. “Life is not flat, that’s for sure,” Elizabeth thought to herself, remembering the sheep in the window back home, and starting to write a poem. It would be about flying through the air, and strange food, and the floury arms of a patriarch.\n	'8':156 'age':334 'aid':380 'air':491 'aloud':163 'anim':57 'arm':327,498 'asio':361,403 'australia':300 'baa':443 'back':476 'bake':389 'barn':62 'bawl':363 'bishop':5,26,261 'black':430 'bloodi':360 'cat':130,355 'caus':216 'child':100 'civil':9 'claric':193,271 'come':67 'cook':69 'could':348,415 'cozi':13 'cri':352 'cupboard':209,434 'curious':429 'cushion':315 'd':388,444,452 'dead':132,357 'decid':140 'detect':101,447 'didn':252 'drop':367 'earlier':390 'earth':281 'eat':35 'elizabeth':4,25,158,410,425,466 'explain':419 'fall':288 'fell':324 'first':46 'flat':461 'flee':223 'fleec':17,244 'fli':303,488 'flouri':497 'food':442,494 'found':203,238,427 'fresh':394 'get':30 'give':269 'glass':226,239 'go':88 'golden':2,137,306 'grass':71 'grizzl':406 'head':28,177 'hear':229,349,416 'heard':262 'help':437 'home':477 'hour':43 'knife':145 'later':128,246 'lawn':373 'lid':23 'lie':104 'life':458 'lightn':65,448 'lispector':194 'long':50 'look':291 'love':121 'lucki':247,249,250 'made':392 'make':10,76 'march':52 'marmoset':188,339 'menzi':111 'mess':78 'microphon':167 'minist':331 'minut':456 'monkey':218 'month':127,245 'move':197 'muck':404 'murmur':343 'necessari':321 'need':86 'never':87 'one':383 'outsid':83 'paint':277 'pass':178 'pastor':335 'patriarch':501 'patti':114,405 'pennsound':235 'pet':117 'poem':483 'poet':103 'poetri':162 'pot':395 'press':59 'prime':330 'read':108,160 'readi':313,417 'record':233 'rememb':470 'report':125 'ride':92 'rins':73 'robert':110,133,175,407 'saw':171,279 'say':98,364 'scone':386 'see':412 'shadow':201 'shearer':237 'sheep':1,20,107,242,311,446,472 'sit':454 'someth':267,272 'sorri':365 'space':333 'spirit':196 'spoon':32,148 'spread':382,431 'start':479 'stori':187 'storm':66 'strang':493 'struck':449 'sure':465 'swoon':39 'syrup':3,138,307 'take':21,254 'televis':150 'tell':124 'think':184 'though':152 'thought':169,337,467 'threw':211 'thumb':256 'tilt':332 'tin':94,206,304 'tip':282 'top':173 'translat':191 'travel':298 'turn':134,408 'unexpect':369 'unopen':205 'upset':421 'use':143 'verandah':221 'via':301 'visitor':370 'want':266,399 'war':51 'wasn':319 'weekend':122 'went':375 'whether':141 'wife':113,351,378,423 'window':181,215,294,475 'wool':274 'woolli':166 'would':485 'write':481 'yes':95 'yet':36

335	The Bells of San Blas	163		\nWhat say the Bells of San Blas To the ships that southward pass        From the harbor of Mazatlan? To them it is nothing more Than the sound of surf on the shore,—        Nothing more to master or man. But to me, a dreamer of dreams, To whom what is and what seems        Are often one and the same,— The Bells of San Blas to me Have a strange, wild melody,        And are something more than a name. For bells are the voice of the church; They have tones that touch and search        The hearts of young and old; One sound to all, yet each Lends a meaning to their speech,        And the meaning is manifold. They are a voice of the Past, Of an age that is fading fast,        Of a power austere and grand; When the flag of Spain unfurled Its folds o'er this western world,        And the Priest was lord of the land. The chapel that once looked down On the little seaport town        Has crumbled into the dust; And on oaken beams below The bells swing to and fro,        And are green with mould and rust. "Is, then, the old faith dead," They say, "and in its stead        Is some new faith proclaimed, That we are forced to remain Naked to sun and rain,        Unsheltered and ashamed? "Once in our tower aloof We rang over wall and roof        Our warnings and our complaints; And round about us there The white doves filled the air,        Like the white souls of the saints. "The saints! Ah, have they grown Forgetful of their own?        Are they asleep, or dead, That open to the sky Their ruined Missions lie,        No longer tenanted?

339	New Heaven, New War	166		\nCome to your heaven, you heavenly choirs, Earth hath the heaven of your desires. Remove your dwelling to your God; A stall is now his best abode. Sith men their homage do deny, Come, angels, all their fault supply. His chilling cold doth heat require; Come, seraphins, in lieu of fire. This little ark no cover hath; Let cherubs’ wings his body swathe. Come, Raphael, this babe must eat; Provide our little Toby meat. Let Gabriel be now his groom, That first took up his earthly room. Let Michael stand in his defense, Whom love hath linked to feeble sense. Let graces rock when he doth cry, And angels sing his lullaby. The same you saw in heavenly seat Is he that now sucks Mary’s teat; Agnize your king a mortal wight, His borrowed weed lets not your sight. Come, kiss the manger where he lies, That is your bliss above the skies. This little babe, so few days old, Is come to rifle Satan’s fold; All hell doth at his presence quake. Though he himself for cold do shake, For in this weak unarmèd wise The gates of hell he will surprise. With tears he fights and wins the field; His naked breast stands for a shield; His battering shot are babish cries, His arrows looks of weeping eyes, His martial ensigns cold and need, And feeble flesh his warrior’s steed. His camp is pitchèd in a stall, His bulwark but a broken wall, The crib his trench, hay stalks his stakes, Of shepherds he his muster makes; And thus, as sure his foe to wound, The angels’ trumps alarum sound. My soul, with Christ join thou in fight; Stick to the tents that he hath pight; Within his crib is surest ward, This little babe will be thy guard. If thou wilt foil thy foes with joy, Then flit not from this heavenly boy.\n	'abod':31 'agniz':132 'alarum':278 'angel':39,113,276 'ark':58 'arrow':222 'babe':71,161,304 'babish':219 'batter':216 'best':30 'bliss':155 'bodi':66 'borrow':139 'boy':323 'breast':210 'broken':251 'bulwark':248 'camp':241 'cherub':63 'chill':45 'choir':11 'christ':283 'cold':46,184,230 'come':5,38,50,68,145,167 'cover':60 'cri':111,220 'crib':254,298 'day':164 'defens':97 'deni':37 'desir':18 'doth':47,110,175 'dwell':21 'earth':12,90 'eat':73 'ensign':229 'eye':226 'fault':42 'feebl':103,234 'field':207 'fight':203,287 'fire':55 'first':86 'flesh':235 'flit':318 'foe':272,314 'foil':312 'fold':172 'gabriel':80 'gate':194 'god':24 'grace':106 'groom':84 'guard':308 'hath':13,61,100,294 'hay':257 'heat':48 'heaven':2,8,10,15,122,322 'hell':174,196 'homag':35 'join':284 'joy':316 'king':134 'kiss':146 'let':62,79,92,105,141 'lie':151 'lieu':53 'link':101 'littl':57,76,160,303 'look':223 'love':99 'lullabi':116 'make':266 'manger':148 'mari':129 'martial':228 'meat':78 'men':33 'michael':93 'mortal':136 'must':72 'muster':265 'nake':209 'need':232 'new':1,3 'old':165 'pight':295 'pitchèd':243 'presenc':178 'provid':74 'quak':179 'raphael':69 'remov':19 'requir':49 'rifl':169 'rock':107 'room':91 'satan':170 'saw':120 'seat':123 'sens':104 'seraphin':51 'shake':186 'shepherd':262 'shield':214 'shot':217 'sight':144 'sing':114 'sith':32 'sky':158 'soul':281 'sound':279 'stake':260 'stalk':258 'stall':26,246 'stand':94,211 'steed':239 'stick':288 'suck':128 'suppli':43 'sure':270 'surest':300 'surpris':199 'swath':67 'tear':201 'teat':131 'tent':291 'thi':307,313 'thou':285,310 'though':180 'thus':268 'tobi':77 'took':87 'trench':256 'trump':277 'unarmèd':191 'wall':252 'war':4 'ward':301 'warrior':237 'weak':190 'weed':140 'weep':225 'wight':137 'wilt':311 'win':205 'wing':64 'wise':192 'within':296 'wound':274

But I would parley fain: Shun not my arrows, and behold my breast.        Yet if thou shunnest, I am thine:        I must be so, if I am mine.        There is no articling with thee: I am but finite, yet thine infinitely.”\n	'also':131 'arrow':221 'articl':244 'artilleri':1,141 'away':115 'began':78 'behold':223 'blood':112 'born':136 'breast':52,225 'cell':9 'clay':212 'cloth':23 'combat':204 'come':31 'contest':208 'day':149 'deign':201 'disobey':46 'dost':159,200 'dread':97 'end':60 'enter':203 'ev':109,187 'even':5 'expel':47 'face':56 'fain':217 'finit':250 'fire':30,58 'god':85 'good':48,104 'grant':179 'hath':186 'heard':39,66 'infinit':253 'know':25 'lap':17 'law':192 'lord':98 'methought':10 'mine':180,240 'minist':87 'mishap':35 'motion':49 'much':169 'muse':80 'music':68 'must':166,234 'n':110,188 'night':147 'oblig':171 'oft':32,102 'one':4,40 'ought':127 'parley':216 'prayer':146 'promis':184 'refus':96,107,160 'rest':62 'rose':19 'said':99 'sat':6 'say':41,167 'servant':139 'set':189 'shook':21 'shoot':14 'shooter':134,196 'shun':218 'shunnest':229 'small':29,34 'speech':75 'sphere':71 'star':12,77,89,132 'still':168 'stubborn':117 'sudden':37 'suffer':124 'tear':144 'thee':156,190,246 'thi':51,138,174,183,191 'thine':210,232,252 'thing':92 'thou':44,158,177,199,228 'thought':118 'turn':82 'us':206 'use':142 'usest':45 'wash':114 'well':26 'whose':86 'woo':151 'work':153 'would':215 'yet':157,226,251

Rich men, trust not in wealth, Gold cannot buy you health; Physic himself must fade. All things to end are made, The plague full swift goes by; I am sick, I must die.    Lord, have mercy on us! Beauty is but a flower Which wrinkles will devour; Brightness falls from the air; Queens have died young and fair; Dust hath closed Helen’s eye. I am sick, I must die.    Lord, have mercy on us! Strength stoops unto the grave, Worms feed on Hector’s brave; Swords may not fight with fate, Earth still holds ope her gate. “Come, come!” the bells do cry. I am sick, I must die.    Lord, have mercy on us. Wit with his wantonness Tasteth death’s bitterness; Hell’s executioner Hath no ears for to hear What vain art can reply. I am sick, I must die.    Lord, have mercy on us. Haste, therefore, each degree, To welcome destiny; Heaven is our heritage, Earth but a player’s stage; Mount we unto the sky.

365	The Description of Cooke-ham	172		\nFarewell (sweet Cooke-ham) where I first obtained Grace from that grace where perfect grace remained; And where the muses gave their full consent, I should have power the virtuous to content; Where princely palace willed me to indite, The sacred story of the soul’s delight. Farewell (sweet place) where virtue then did rest, And all delights did harbor in her breast; Never shall my sad eyes again behold Those pleasures which my thoughts did then unfold. Yet you (great Lady) Mistress of that place, From whose desires did spring this work of grace; Vouchsafe to think upon those pleasures past, As fleeting worldly joys that could not last, Or, as dim shadows of celestial pleasures, Which are desired above all earthly treasures. Oh how (methought) against you thither came, Each part did seem some new delight to frame! The house received all ornaments to grace it, And would endure no foulness to deface it. And walks put on their summer liveries, And all things else did hold like similes. The trees with leaves, with fruits, with flowers clad, Embraced each other, seeming to be glad, Turning themselves to beauteous Canopies, To shade the bright sun from your brighter eyes; The crystal streams with silver spangles graced, While by the glorious sun they were embraced; The little birds in chirping notes did sing, To entertain both you and that sweet spring. And Philomela with her sundry lays, Both you and that delightful place did praise. Oh how me thought each plant, each flower, each tree Set forth their beauties then to welcome thee! The very hills right humbly did descend, When you to tread on them did intend. And as you set your feet, they still did rise, Glad that they could receive so rich a prize. The gentle winds did take delight to be Among those woods that were so graced by thee, And in sad murmur uttered pleasing sound, That pleasure in that place might more abound. The swelling banks delivered all their pride When such a Phoenix once they had espied. Each arbor, bank, each seat, each stately tree, Thought themselves honored in supporting thee; The pretty birds would oft come to attend thee, Yet fly away for fear they should offend thee; The little creatures in the burrough by Would come abroad to sport them in your eye, Yet fearful of the bow in your fair hand. Would run away when you did make a stand. Now let me come unto that stately tree, Wherein such goodly prospects you did see; That oak that did in height his fellows pass, As much as lofty trees, low growing grass, Much like a comely cedar straight and tall, Whose beauteous stature far exceeded all. How often did you visit this fair tree, Which seeming joyful in receiving thee, Would like a palm tree spread his arms abroad, Desirous that you there should make abode; Whose fair green leaves much like a comely veil, Defended Phoebus when he would assail; Whose pleasing boughs did yield a cool fresh air, Joying his happiness when you were there. Where being seated, you might plainly see Hills, vales, and woods, as if on bended knee They had appeared, your honor to salute, Or to prefer some strange unlooked-for suit; All interlaced with brooks and crystal springs, A prospect fit to please the eyes of kings. And thirteen shires appeared all in your sight, Europe could not afford much more delight. What was there then but gave you all content, While you the time in meditation spent Of their Creator’s power, which there you saw, In all his creatures held a perfect law; And in their beauties did you plain descry His beauty, wisdom, grace, love, majesty. In these sweet woods how often did you walk, With Christ and his Apostles there to talk; Placing his holy Writ in some fair tree To meditate what you therein did see. With Moses you did mount his holy hill To know his pleasure, and perform his will. With lowly David you did often sing His holy hymns to Heaven’s eternal King. And in sweet music did your soul delight To sound his praises, morning, noon, and night. With blessed Joseph you did often feed Your pined brethren, when they stood in need. And that sweet Lady sprung from Clifford’s race, Of noble Bedford’s blood, fair stem of grace, To honorable Dorset now espoused, In whose fair breast true virtue then was housed, Oh what delight did my weak spirits find In those pure parts of her well framèd mind. And yet it grieves me that I cannot be Near unto her, whose virtues did agree With those fair ornaments of outward beauty, Which did enforce from all both love and duty. Unconstant Fortune, thou art most to blame, Who casts us down into so low a frame Where our great friends we cannot daily see, So great a difference is there in degree. Many are placed in those orbs of state, Partners in honor, so ordained by Fate, Nearer in show, yet farther off in love, In which, the lowest always are above. But whither am I carried in conceit, My wit too weak to conster of the great. Why not? although we are but born of earth, We may behold the heavens, despising death; And loving heaven that is so far above, May in the end vouchsafe us entire love. Therefore sweet memory do thou retain Those pleasures past, which will not turn again: Remember beauteous Dorset’s former sports, So far from being touched by ill reports, Wherein myself did always bear a part, While reverend love presented my true heart. Those recreations let me bear in mind, Which her sweet youth and noble thoughts did find, Whereof deprived, I evermore must grieve, Hating blind Fortune, careless to relieve, And you sweet Cooke-ham, whom these ladies leave, I now must tell the grief you did conceive At their departure, when they went away, How everything retained a sad dismay. Nay long before, when once an inkling came, Methought each thing did unto sorrow frame: The trees that were so glorious in our view, Forsook both flowers and fruit, when once they knew Of your depart, their very leaves did wither, Changing their colors as they grew together. But when they saw this had no power to stay you, They often wept, though, speechless, could not pray you, Letting their tears in your fair bosoms fall, As if they said, Why will ye leave us all? This being vain, they cast their leaves away Hoping that pity would have made you stay: Their frozen tops, like age’s hoary hairs, Shows their disasters, languishing in fears. A swarthy riveled rind all over spread, Their dying bodies half alive, half dead. But your occasions called you so away That nothing there had power to make you stay. Yet did I see a noble grateful mind Requiting each according to their kind, Forgetting not to turn and take your leave Of these sad creatures, powerless to receive Your favor, when with grief you did depart, Placing their former pleasures in your heart, Giving great charge to noble memory There to preserve their love continually. But specially the love of that fair tree, That first and last you did vouchsafe to see, In which it pleased you oft to take the air With noble Dorset, then a virgin fair, Where many a learned book was read and scanned, To this fair tree, taking me by the hand, You did repeat the pleasures which had passed, Seeming to grieve they could no longer last. And with a chaste, yet loving kiss took leave, Of which sweet kiss I did it soon bereave, Scorning a senseless creature should possess So rare a favor, so great happiness. No other kiss it could receive from me, For fear to give back what it took of thee, So I ungrateful creature did deceive it Of that which you in love vouchsafed to leave it. And though it oft had given me much content, Yet this great wrong I never could repent; But of the happiest made it most forlorn, To show that nothing’s free from Fortune’s scorne, While all the rest with this most beauteous tree Made their sad consort sorrow’s harmony. The flowers that on the banks and walks did grow, Crept in the ground, the grass did weep for woe. The winds and waters seemed to chide together Because you went away they knew not whither; And those sweet brooks that ran so fair and clear, With grief and trouble wrinkled did appear. Those pretty birds that wonted were to sing, Now neither sing, nor chirp, nor use their wing, But with their tender feet on some bare spray, Warble forth sorrow, and their own dismay. Fair Philomela leaves her mournful ditty, Drowned in deep sleep, yet can procure no pity. Each arbor, bank, each seat, each stately tree Looks bare and desolate now for want of thee, Turning green tresses into frosty gray, While in cold grief they wither all away. The sun grew weak, his beams no comfort gave, While all green things did make the earth their grave. Each brier, each bramble, when you went away Caught fast your clothes, thinking to make you stay; Delightful Echo wonted to reply To our last words, did now for sorrow die; The house cast off each garment that might grace it, Putting on dust and cobwebs to deface it. All desolation then there did appear, When you were going whom they held so dear. This last farewell to Cooke-ham here I give, When I am dead thy name in this may live, Wherein I have performed her noble hest  Whose virtues lodge in my unworthy breast, And ever shall, so long as life remains, Tying my life to her by those rich chains.\n	'abod':494 'abound':337 'abroad':394,487 'accord':1179 'afford':585 'age':1129 'agre':794 'air':518,1251 'aliv':1150 'although':891

366	A Valediction of the Book	173		\nI’ll tell thee now (dear Love) what thou shalt do     To anger destiny, as she doth us,     How I shall stay, though she esloygne me thus And how posterity shall know it too;          How thine may out-endure          Sybil’s glory, and obscure          Her who from Pindar could allure,     And her, through whose help Lucan is not lame, And her, whose book (they say) Homer did find, and name. Study our manuscripts, those myriads     Of letters, which have past twixt thee and me,     Thence write our annals, and in them will be   To all whom love’s subliming fire invades,          Rule and example found;          There, the faith of any ground          No schismatic will dare to wound,     That sees, how Love this grace to us affords, To make, to keep, to use, to be these his records. This book, as long-lived as the elements,     Or as the world’s form, this all-graved tome     In cipher writ, or new made idiom; We for love’s clergy only’are instruments,          When this book is made thus,          Should again the ravenous          Vandals and the Goths invade us,     Learning were safe; in this our universe Schools might learn sciences, spheres music, angels verse. Here Love’s divines (since all divinity     Is love or wonder) may find all they seek,     Whether abstract spiritual love they like, Their souls exhaled with what they do not see,          Or loth so to amuse          Faith’s infirmity, they choose          Something which they may see and use;     For, though mind be the heaven, where love doth sit, Beauty’a convenient type may be to figure it. Here more than in their books may lawyers find,     Both by what titles mistresses are ours,     And how prerogative these states devours, Transferred from Love himself, to womankind,          Who though from heart, and eyes,          They exact great subsidies,          Forsake him who on them relies     And for the cause, honor, or conscience give, Chimeras, vain as they, or their prerogative. Here statesmen (or of them, they which can read)     May of their occupation find the grounds,     Love and their art alike it deadly wounds, If to consider what’tis, one proceed,          In both they do excel          Who the present govern well,          Whose weakness none doth, or dares tell;     In this thy book, such will there nothing see, As in the Bible some can find out alchemy. Thus vent thy thoughts; abroad I’ll study thee,     As he removes far off, that great heights takes;     How great love is, presence best trial makes, But absence tries how long this love will be;          To take a latitude          Sun, or stars, are fitliest viewed          At their brightest, but to conclude,     Of longitudes, what other way have we, But to mark when, and where the dark eclipses be?\n	'abroad':406 'absenc':429 'abstract':227 'afford':132 'alchemi':401 'alik':356 'all-grav':160 'allur':56 'amus':245 'angel':208 'anger':18 'annal':94 'art':355 'beauti':268 'best':425 'bibl':396 'book':5,69,145,181,282,387 'brightest':449 'caus':324 'chimera':329 'choos':250 'cipher':165 'clergi':175 'conclud':452 'conscienc':327 'consid':362 'conveni':270 'could':55 'dare':121,382 'dark':467 'dead':358 'dear':11 'destini':19 'devour':298 'divin':213,216 'doth':22,266,380 'eclips':468 'element':152 'endur':45 'esloygn':30 'exact':312 'exampl':110 'excel':371 'exhal':234 'eye':310 'faith':114,246 'far':414 'figur':275 'find':74,222,285,349,399 'fire':106 'fitliest':445 'form':158 'forsak':315 'found':111 'give':328 'glori':48 'goth':192 'govern':375 'grace':129 'grave':162 'great':313,417,421 'ground':117,351 'heart':308 'heaven':263 'height':418 'help':61 'homer':72 'honor':325 'idiom':170 'infirm':248 'instrument':178 'invad':107,193 'keep':136 'know':37 'lame':65 'latitud':440 'lawyer':284 'learn':195,204 'letter':83 'like':231 'live':149 'll':7,408 'long':148,432 'long-liv':147 'longitud':454 'loth':242 'love':12,103,127,173,211,218,229,265,301,352,422,434 'lucan':62 'made':169,183 'make':134,427 'manuscript':79 'mark':462 'may':42,221,254,272,283,345 'might':203 'mind':260 'mistress':290 'music':207 'myriad':81 'name':76 'new':168 'none':379 'noth':391 'obscur':50 'occup':348 'one':365 'out-endur':43 'past':86 'pindar':54 'poster':35 'prerog':295,335 'presenc':424 'present':374 'proceed':366 'raven':188 'read':344 'record':143 'reli':320 'remov':413 'rule':108 'safe':197 'say':71 'schismat':119 'school':202 'scienc':205 'see':125,240,255,392 'seek':225 'shall':26,36 'shalt':15 'sinc':214 'sit':267 'someth':251 'soul':233 'sphere':206 'spiritu':228 'star':443 'state':297 'statesmen':337 'stay':27 'studi':77,409 'sublim':105 'subsidi':314 'sun':441 'sybil':46 'take':419,438 'tell':8,383 'thee':9,88,410 'thenc':91 'thi':386,404 'thine':41 'thou':14 'though':28,259,306 'thought':405 'thus':32,184,402 'tis':364 'titl':289 'tome':163 'transfer':299 'tri':430 'trial':426 'twixt':87 'type':271 'univers':201 'us':23,131,194 'use':138,257 'vain':330 'valedict':2 'vandal':189 'vent':403 'vers':209 'view':446 'way':457 'weak':378 'well':376 'whether':226 'whose':60,68,377 'womankind':304 'wonder':220 'world':156 'wound':123,359 'writ':166 'write':92
367	Elegy VII: Nature’s lay idiot, I taught thee to love	173		\nNature’s lay idiot, I taught thee to love, And in that sophistry, oh, thou dost prove Too subtle: Fool, thou didst not understand The mystic language of the eye nor hand: Nor couldst thou judge the difference of the air Of sighs, and say, this lies, this sounds despair: Nor by the’eye’s water call a malady Desperately hot, or changing feverously. I had not taught thee then, the alphabet Of flowers, how they devicefully being set And bound up, might with speechless secrecy Deliver errands mutely, and mutually. Remember since all thy words used to be To every suitor, “I, ’if my friends agree”; Since, household charms, thy husband’s name to teach, Were all the love-tricks, that thy wit could reach; And since, an hour’s discourse could scarce have made One answer in thee, and that ill arrayed  In broken proverbs, and torn sentences. Thou art not by so many duties his, That from the’world’s common having severed thee, Inlaid thee, neither to be seen, nor see, As mine: who have with amorous delicacies Refined thee’into a blissful paradise. Thy graces and good words my creatures be; I planted knowledge and life’s tree in thee, Which oh, shall strangers taste? Must I alas  Frame and enamel plate, and drink in glass? Chafe wax for others’ seals? break a colt’s force And leave him then, being made a ready horse?\n	'agre':118 'air':52 'ala':225 'alphabet':83 'amor':193 'answer':150 'array':156 'art':164 'bliss':199 'bound':92 'break':239 'broken':158 'call':68 'chafe':234 'chang':74 'charm':121 'colt':241 'common':176 'could':137,145 'couldst':45 'creatur':207 'delicaci':194 'deliv':98 'despair':61 'desper':71 'devic':88 'didst':33 'differ':49 'discours':144 'dost':27 'drink':231 'duti':169 'elegi':1 'enamel':228 'errand':99 'everi':112 'eye':41,65 'fever':75 'flower':85 'fool':31 'forc':243 'frame':226 'friend':117 'glass':233 'good':204 'grace':202 'hand':43 'hors':252 'hot':72 'hour':142 'household':120 'husband':123 'idiot':6,15 'ill':155 'inlaid':180 'judg':47 'knowledg':211 'languag':38 'lay':5,14 'leav':245 'lie':58 'life':213 'love':11,20,132 'love-trick':131 'made':148,249 'maladi':70 'mani':168 'might':94 'mine':189 'must':223 'mute':100 'mutual':102 'mystic':37 'name':125 'natur':3,12 'neither':182 'oh':25,219 'one':149 'other':237 'paradis':200 'plant':210 'plate':229 'prove':28 'proverb':159 'reach':138 'readi':251 'refin':195 'rememb':103 'say':56 'scarc':146 'seal':238 'secreci':97 'see':187 'seen':185 'sentenc':162 'set':90 'sever':178 'shall':220 'sigh':54 'sinc':104,119,140 'sophistri':24 'sound':60 'speechless':96 'stranger':221 'subtl':30 'suitor':113 'tast':222 'taught':8,17,79 'teach':127 'thee':9,18,80,152,179,181,196,217 'thi':106,122,135,201 'thou':26,32,46,163 'torn':161 'tree':215 'trick':133 'understand':35 'use':108 'vii':2 'water':67 'wax':235 'wit':136 'word':107,205 'world':174

372	To Sir Henry Cary	174		\nThat neither fame nor love might wanting be To greatness, Cary, I sing that and thee; Whose house, if it no other honor had, In only thee might be both great and glad; Who, to upbraid the sloth of this our time, Durst valor make almost, but not, a crime; Which deed I know not, whether were more high, Or thou more happy, it to justify Against thy fortune: when no foe, that day, Could conquer thee but chance, who did betray. Love thy great loss, which a renown hath won, To live when Broick not stands, nor Ruhr doth run.

That he, untraveled, should be French so much As Frenchmen in his company should seem Dutch? Or had his father, when he did him get, The French disease, with which he labors yet? Or hung some monsieur’s picture on the wall, By which his dam conceived him, clothes and all? Or is it some French statue? No: ’T doth move, And stoop, and cringe.

376	Inviting a Friend to Supper	174		\nTonight, grave sir, both my poor house, and I Do equally desire your company; Not that we think us worthy such a guest, But that your worth will dignify our feast With those that come, whose grace may make that seem Something, which else could hope for no esteem. It is the fair acceptance, sir, creates The entertainment perfect, not the cates. Yet shall you have, to rectify your palate, An olive, capers, or some better salad Ushering the mutton; with a short-legged hen, If we can get her, full of eggs, and then Lemons, and wine for sauce; to these a cony Is not to be despaired of, for our money; And, though fowl now be scarce, yet there are clerks, The sky not falling, think we may have larks. I’ll tell you of more, and lie, so you will come: Of partridge, pheasant, woodcock, of which some May yet be there, and godwit, if we can; Knat, rail, and ruff too. Howsoe’er, my man Shall read a piece of Virgil, Tacitus, Livy, or of some better book to us, Of which we’ll speak our minds, amidst our meat; And I’ll profess no verses to repeat. To this, if ought appear which I not know of, That will the pastry, not my paper, show of.Digestive cheese and fruit there sure will be; But that which most doth take my Muse and me, Is a pure cup of rich Canary wine, Which is the Mermaid’s now, but shall be mine; Of which had Horace, or Anacreon tasted, Their lives, as so their lines, till now had lasted. Tobacco, nectar, or the Thespian spring, Are all but Luther's beer to this I sing. Of this we will sup free, but moderately, And we will have no Pooley, or Parrot by, Nor shall our cups make any guilty men; But, at our parting we will be as when We innocently met. No simple word That shall be uttered at our mirthful board, Shall make us sad next morning or affright The liberty that we’ll enjoy tonight.\n	'accept':59 'affright':351 'amidst':198 'anacreon':268 'appear':213 'beer':291 'better':81,187 'board':343 'book':188 'canari':251 'caper':78 'cate':67 'chees':228 'clerk':129 'come':40,150 'compani':19 'coni':110 'could':50 'creat':61 'cup':248,316 'desir':17 'despair':115 'dignifi':34 'doth':239 'egg':99 'els':49 'enjoy':357 'entertain':63 'equal':16 'er':173 'esteem':54 'fair':58 'fall':133 'feast':36 'fowl':122 'free':301 'friend':3 'fruit':230 'full':97 'get':95 'godwit':163 'grace':42 'grave':7 'guest':28 'guilti':319 'hen':91 'hope':51 'horac':266 'hous':12 'howso':172 'innoc':331 'invit':1 'knat':167 'know':217 'lark':138 'last':279 'leg':90 'lemon':102 'liberti':353 'lie':146 'line':275 'live':271 'livi':183 'll':140,194,203,356 'luther':289 'make':44,317,345 'man':175 'may':43,136,158 'meat':200 'men':320 'mermaid':256 'met':332 'mind':197 'mine':262 'mirth':342 'moder':303 'money':119 'morn':349 'muse':242 'mutton':85 'nectar':281 'next':348 'of.digestive':227 'oliv':77 'ought':212 'palat':75 'paper':225 'parrot':311 'part':324 'partridg':152 'pastri':222 'perfect':64 'pheasant':153 'piec':179 'pooley':309 'poor':11 'profess':204 'pure':247 'rail':168 'read':177 'rectifi':73 'repeat':208 'rich':250 'ruff':170 'sad':347 'salad':82 'sauc':106 'scarc':125 'seem':46 'shall':69,176,260,314,337,344 'short':89 'short-leg':88 'show':226 'simpl':334 'sing':295 'sir':8,60 'sky':131 'someth':47 'speak':195 'spring':285 'sup':300 'supper':5 'sure':232 'tacitus':182 'take':240 'tast':269 'tell':141 'thespian':284 'think':23,134 'though':121 'till':276 'tobacco':280 'tonight':6,358 'us':24,190,346 'usher':83 'utter':339 'vers':206 'virgil':181 'whose':41 'wine':104,252 'woodcock':154 'word':335 'worth':32 'worthi':25 'yet':68,126,159

378	To Penshurst	174		\nThou art not, Penshurst, built to envious show,\rOf touch or marble; nor canst boast a row\rOf polished pillars, or a roof of gold;\rThou hast no lantern, whereof tales are told,\rOr stair, or courts; but stand’st an ancient pile,\rAnd, these grudged at, art reverenced the while.\rThou joy’st in better marks, of soil, of air,\rOf wood, of water; therein thou art fair.\rThou hast thy walks for health, as well as sport;\rThy mount, to which the dryads do resort,\rWhere Pan and Bacchus their high feasts have made,\rBeneath the broad beech and the chestnut shade;\rThat taller tree, which of a nut was set\rAt his great birth where all the Muses met.\rThere in the writhèd bark are cut the names\rOf many a sylvan, taken with his flames;\rAnd thence the ruddy satyrs oft provoke\rThe lighter fauns to reach thy Lady’s Oak.\rThy copse too, named of Gamage, thou hast there,\rThat never fails to serve thee seasoned deer\rWhen thou wouldst feast or exercise thy friends.\rThe lower land, that to the river bends,\rThy sheep, thy bullocks, kine, and calves do feed;\rThe middle grounds thy mares and horses breed.\rEach bank doth yield thee conies; and the tops,\rFertile of wood, Ashore and Sidney’s copse,\rTo crown thy open table, doth provide\rThe purpled pheasant with the speckled side;\rThe painted partridge lies in every field,\rAnd for thy mess is willing to be killed.\rAnd if the high-swollen Medway fail thy dish,\rThou hast thy ponds, that pay thee tribute fish,\rFat aged carps that run into thy net,\rAnd pikes, now weary their own kind to eat,\rAs loath the second draught or cast to stay,\rOfficiously at first themselves betray;\rBright eels that emulate them, and leap on land\rBefore the fisher, or into his hand.\rThen hath thy orchard fruit, thy garden flowers,\rFresh as the air, and new as are the hours.\rThe early cherry, with the later plum,\rFig, grape, and quince, each in his time doth come;\rThe blushing apricot and woolly peach \rHang on thy walls, that every child may reach.\rAnd though thy walls be of the country stone,\rThey’re reared with no man’s ruin, no man’s groan;\rThere’s none that dwell about them wish them down;\rBut all come in, the farmer and the clown,\rAnd no one empty-handed, to salute\rThy lord and lady, though they have no suit.\rSome bring a capon, some a rural cake,\rSome nuts, some apples; some that think they make\rThe better cheeses bring them, or else send\rBy their ripe daughters, whom they would commend\rThis way to husbands, and whose baskets bear\rAn emblem of themselves in plum or pear.\rBut what can this (more than express their love)\rAdd to thy free provisions, far above\rThe need of such? whose liberal board doth flow\rWith all that hospitality doth know;\rWhere comes no guest but is allowed to eat,\rWithout his fear, and of thy lord’s own meat;\rWhere the same beer and bread, and selfsame wine,\rThis is his lordship’s shall be also mine,\rAnd I not fain to sit (as some this day\rAt great men’s tables), and yet dine away.\rHere no man tells my cups; nor, standing by,\rA waiter doth my gluttony envy,\rBut gives me what I call, and lets me eat;\rHe knows below he shall find plenty of meat.\rThe tables hoard not up for the next day;\rNor, when I take my lodging, need I pray\rFor fire, or lights, or livery; all is there,\rAs if thou then wert mine, or I reigned here:\rThere’s nothing I can wish, for which I stay.\rThat found King James when, hunting late this way\rWith his brave son, the prince, they saw thy fires\rShine bright on every hearth, as the desires\rOf thy Penates had been set on flame\rTo entertain them; or the country came\rWith all their zeal to warm their welcome here.\rWhat (great I will not say, but) sudden cheer\rDidst thou then make ’em! and what praise was heaped \rOn thy good lady then, who therein reaped\rThe just reward of her high housewifery;\rTo have her linen, plate, and all things nigh,\rWhen she was far; and not a room but dressed\rAs if it had expected such a guest!\rThese, Penshurst, are thy praise, and yet not all.\rThy lady’s noble, fruitful, chaste withal.\rHis children thy great lord may call his own,\rA fortune in this age but rarely known.\rThey are, and have been, taught religion; thence\rTheir gentler spirits have sucked innocence.\rEach morn and even they are taught to pray,\rWith the whole household, and may, every day,\rRead in their virtuous parents’ noble parts\rThe mysteries of manners, arms, and arts.\rNow, Penshurst, they that will proportion thee\rWith other edifices, when they see\rThose proud, ambitious heaps, and nothing else,\rMay say their lords have built, but thy lord dwells.\n	'add':486 'age':275,786 'air':63,332 'allow':514 'also':543 'ambiti':850 'ancient':44 'appl':439 'apricot':358 'arm':832 'art':4,50,70,834 'ashor':220 'away':563 'bacchus':93 'bank':209 'bark':129 'basket':467 'bear':468 'beech':102 'beer':530 'bend':190 'beneath':99 'betray':304 'better':58,446 'birth':119 'blush':357 'board':499 'boast':17 'brave':656 'bread':532 'breed':207 'bright':305,665 'bring':429,448 'broad':101 'built':7,860 'bullock':194 'cake':435 'call':584,779 'calv':197 'came':686 'canst':16 'capon':431 'carp':276 'cast':297 'chast':771 'cheer':704 'chees':447 'cherri':341 'chestnut':105 'child':368 'children':774 'clown':410 'come':355,404,509 'commend':460 'coni':213 'cops':159,224 'countri':378,685 'court':39 'crown':226 'cup':569 'cut':131 'daughter':456 'day':554,606,820 'deer':174 'desir':671 'didst':705 'dine':562 'dish':264 'doth':210,230,354,500,506,575 'draught':295 'dress':748 'dryad':87 'dwell':396,864 'earli':340 'eat':290,516,588 'edific':844 'eel':306 'els':451,854 'em':709 'emblem':470 'empti':415 'empty-hand':414 'emul':308 'entertain':681 'envi':578 'envious':9 'even':807 'everi':244,367,667,819 'exercis':180 'expect':753 'express':483 'fail':169,262 'fain':548 'fair':71 'far':491,742 'farmer':407 'fat':274 'faun':151 'fear':519 'feast':96,178 'feed':199 'fertil':217 'field':245 'fig':346 'find':594 'fire':617,663 'first':302 'fish':273 'fisher':316 'flame':141,679 'flow':501 'flower':328 'fortun':783 'found':646 'free':489 'fresh':329 'friend':182 'fruit':325,770 'gamag':163 'garden':327 'gentler':799 'give':580 'gluttoni':577 'gold':27 'good':717 'grape':347 'great':118,556,697,776 'groan':391 'ground':202 'grudg':48 'guest':511,756 'hand':320,416 'hang':362 'hast':29,73,165,266 'hath':322 'health':77 'heap':714,851 'hearth':668 'high':95,259,728 'high-swollen':258 'hoard':600 'hors':206 'hospit':505 'hour':338 'household':816 'housewiferi':729 'hunt':650 'husband':464 'innoc':803 'jame':648 'joy':55 'kill':254 'kind':288 'kine':195 'king':647 'know':507,590 'known':789 'ladi':155,422,718,767 'land':185,313 'lantern':31 'late':651 'later':344 'leap':311 'let':586 'liber':498 'lie':242 'light':619 'lighter':150 'linen':733 'liveri':621 'loath':292 'lodg':612 'lord':420,523,777,858,863 'lordship':539 'love':485 'lower':184 'made':98 'make':444,708 'man':385,389,566 'mani':135 'manner':831 'marbl':14 'mare':204 'mark':59 'may':369,778,818,855 'meat':526,597 'medway':261 'men':557 'mess':249 'met':124 'middl':201 'mine':544,630 'morn':805 'mount':83 'muse':123 'mysteri':829 'name':133,161 'need':494,613 'net':281 'never':168 'new':334 'next':605 'nigh':738 'nobl':769,826 'none':394 'noth':637,853 'nut':113,437 'oak':157 'offici':300 'oft':147 'one':413 'open':228 'orchard':324 'paint':240 'pan':91 'parent':825 'part':827 'partridg':241 'pay':270 'peach':361 'pear':476 'penat':674 'penshurst':2,6,758,836 'pheasant':234 'pike':283 'pile':45 'pillar':22 'plate':734 'plenti':595 'plum':345,474 'polish':21 'pond':268 'prais':712,761 'pray':615,812 'princ':659 'proport':840 'proud':849 'provid':231 'provis':490 'provok':148 'purpl':233 'quinc':349 'rare':788 're':381 'reach':153,370 'read':821 'reap':722 'rear':382 'reign':633 'religion':796 'resort':89 'reverenc':51 'reward':725 'ripe':455 'river':189 'roof':25 'room':746 'row':19 'ruddi':145 'ruin':387 'run':278 'rural':434 'salut':418 'satyr':146 'saw':661 'say':701,856 'season':173 'second':294 'see':847 'selfsam':534 'send':452 'serv':171 'set':115,677 'shade':106 'shall':541,593 'sheep':192 'shine':664 'show':10 'side':238 'sidney':222 'sit':550 'soil':61 'son':657 'speckl':237 'spirit':800 'sport':81 'st':42,56 'stair':37 'stand':41,571 'stay':299,644 'stone':379 'suck':802 'sudden':703 'suit':427 'swollen':260 'sylvan':137 'tabl':229,559,599 'take':610 'taken':138 'tale':33 'taller':108 'taught':795,810 'tell':567 'thee':172,212,271,841 'thenc':143,797 'therein':68,721 'thi':74,82,154,158,181,191,193,203,227,248,263,267,280,323,326,364,373,419,488,522,662,673,716,760,766,775,862 'thing':737 'think':442 'thou':3,28,54,69,72,164,176,265,627,706 'though':372,423 'time':353 'told':35 'top':216 'touch':12 'tree':109 'tribut':272 'virtuous':824 'waiter':574 'walk':75 'wall':365,374 'warm':692 'water':67 'way':462,653 'weari':285 'welcom':694 'well':79 'wert':629 'whereof':32 'whole':815 'whose':466,497 'will':251 'wine':535 'wish':399,640 'withal':772 'without':517 'wood':65,219 'woolli':360 'would':459 'wouldst':177 'writhèd':128 'yet':561,763 'yield':211 'zeal':690
379	Song: to Celia [Come, my Celia, let us prove]	174		\nCome, my Celia, let us prove, While we can, the sports of love; Time will not be ours forever; He at length our good will sever. Spend not then his gifts in vain. Suns that set may rise again; But if once we lose this light, ’Tis with us perpetual night. Why should we defer our joys? Fame and rumor are but toys. Cannot we delude the eyes Of a few poor household spies, Or his easier ears beguile, So removèd by our wile? ’Tis no sin love’s fruit to steal; But the sweet thefts to reveal, To be taken, to be seen, These have crimes accounted been.\n	'account':117 'beguil':88 'cannot':73 'celia':3,6,12 'come':4,10 'crime':116 'defer':64 'delud':75 'ear':87 'easier':86 'eye':77 'fame':67 'forev':28 'fruit':99 'gift':40 'good':33 'household':82 'joy':66 'length':31 'let':7,13 'light':55 'lose':53 'love':22,97 'may':46 'night':60 'perpetu':59 'poor':81 'prove':9,15 'removèd':90 'reveal':107 'rise':47 'rumor':69 'seen':113 'set':45 'sever':35 'sin':96 'song':1 'spend':36 'spi':83 'sport':20 'steal':101 'sun':43 'sweet':104 'taken':110 'theft':105 'time':23 'tis':56,94 'toy':72 'us':8,14,58 'vain':42 'wile':93
380	An Elegy	174		\nThough beauty be the mark of praise,    And yours of whom I sing be such    As not the world can praise too much, Yet ’tis your virtue now I raise. A virtue, like allay, so gone    Throughout your form, as, though that move    And draw and conquer all men’s love, This sùbjects you to love of one. Wherein you triumph yet; because    ’Tis of yourself, and that you use    The noblest freedom, not to choose Against or faith or honor’s laws. But who should less expect from you,    In whom alone Love lives again?    By whom he is restored to men, And kept, and bred, and brought up true. His falling temples you have reared,    The withered garlands ta’en away;    His altars kept from the decay That envy wished, and nature feared; And on them burn so chaste a flame,    With so much loyalties’ expense,    As Love, t’ acquit such excellence, Is gone himself into your name.

381	To the Immortal Memory and Friendship of That Noble Pair, Sir Lucius Cary and Sir Henry Morison	174		\n               The Turn Brave infant of Saguntum, clear Thy coming forth in that great year, When the prodigious Hannibal did crown His rage with razing your immortal town. Thou, looking then about, Ere thou wert half got out, Wise child, didst hastily return, And mad’st thy mother’s womb thine urn. How summed a circle didst thou leave mankind   Of deepest lore, could we the center find!                The Counterturn Did wiser Nature draw thee back From out the horror of that sack, Where shame, faith, honor, and regard of right Lay trampled on; the deeds of death and night Urged, hurried forth, and hurled Upon th’ affrighted world; Sword, fire, and famine, with fell fury met, And all on utmost ruin set, As, could they but life’s miseries foresee, No doubt all infants would return like thee?                The Stand For what is life, if measured by the space, Not by the act? Or maskèd man, if valued by his face Above his fact? Here’s one outlived his peers And told forth fourscore years; He vexèd time and busied the whole state, Troubled both foes and friends; But ever to no ends: What did this stirrer but die late? How well at twenty had he fall’n or stood! For three of his fourscore he did no good.                The Turn He entered well, by virtuous parts, Got up and thrived with honest arts; He purchased friends, and fame, and honors then, And had his noble name advanced with men; But weary of that flight He stooped in all men’s sight To sordid flatteries, acts of strife, And sunk in that dead sea of life So deep, as he did then death’s waters sup, But that the cork of title buoyed him up.                The Counterturn Alas, but Morison fell young; He never fell, thou fall’st, my tongue. He stood, a soldier to the last right end, A perfect patriot, and a noble friend, But most a virtuous son. All offices were done By him so ample, full, and round, In weight, in measure, number, sound, As, though his age imperfect might appear, His life was of humanity the sphere.                The Stand Go now, and tell out days summed up with fears, And make them years; Produce thy mass of miseries on the stage   To swell thin age; Repeat of things a throng, To show thou hast been long, Not lived; for life doth her great actions spell By what was done and wrought In season, and so brought To light: her measures are, how well Each syllabe answered, and was formed how fair; These make the lines of life, and that’s her air.                The Turn It is not growing like a tree In bulk doth make man better be; Or standing long an oak, three hundred year, To fall a log at last, dry, bald, and sere: A lily of a day Is fairer far in May; Although it fall and die that night, It was the plant and flower of light. In small proportions we just beauties see, And in short measures life may perfect be.                The Counterturn Call, noble Lucius, then for wine, And let thy looks with gladness shine; Accept this garland, plant it on thy head, And think, nay know, thy Morison’s not dead. He leaped the present age, Possessed with holy rage To see that bright eternal day; Of which we priests and poets say Such truths as we expect for happy men, And there he lives with memory, and Ben                The Stand Jonson! who sung thus of him, ere he went Himself to rest, Or taste a part of that full joy he meant   To have expressed   In this bright asterism; Where it were friendship’s schism (Were not his Lucius long with us to tarry) To separate these twi- Lights, the Dioscuri, And keep the one half from his Harry. But fate doth so alternate the design, Whilst that in heaven, this light on earth must shine.                The Turn And shine as you exalted are, Two names of friendship, but one star: Of hearts the union. And those not by chance Made, or indenture, or leased out t’advance The profits for a time. No pleasures vain did chime Of rimes, or riots, at your feasts, Orgies of drink, or feigned protests, But simple love of greatness and of good; That knits brave minds and manners more than blood.                The Counterturn This made you first to know the why You liked, then after to apply That liking, and approach so one the tother, Till either grew a portion of the other: Each styled by his end The copy of his friend. You lived to be the great surnames And titles by which all made claims Unto the virtue. Nothing perfect done, But as a Cary, or a Morison.                The Stand And such a force the fair example had, As they that saw The good, and durst not practice it, were glad That such a law Was left yet to mankind; Where they might read and find Friendship, indeed, was written, not in words; And with the heart, not pen, Of two so early men, Whose lines her rolls were, and recòrds, Who, ere the first down bloomèd on the chin, Had sowed these fruits, and got the harvest in.\n	'accept':554 'act':170,283 'action':426 'advanc':265,718 'affright':124 'age':369,407,575 'air':464 'ala':315 'altern':674 'although':509 'ampl':356 'answer':448 'appear':372 'appli':774 'approach':778 'art':251 'aster':639 'back':92 'bald':496 'beauti':529 'ben':608 'better':479 'blood':758 'bloomèd':896 'brave':20,752 'bright':583,638 'brought':438 'bulk':475 'buoy':310 'busi':197 'call':541 'cari':13,824 'center':83 'chanc':710 'child':56 'chime':728 'chin':899 'circl':72 'claim':814 'clear':24 'come':26 'copi':797 'cork':307 'could':80,141 'counterturn':86,314,540,760 'crown':37 'day':387,503,585 'dead':290,570 'death':114,300 'deed':112 'deep':295 'deepest':78 'design':676 'didst':57,73 'die':216,513 'dioscuri':661 'done':352,431,820 'doth':423,476,672 'doubt':149 'draw':90 'dri':495 'drink':738 'durst':845 'earli':882 'earth':684 'either':784 'end':210,336,795 'enter':240 'ere':49,617,892 'etern':584 'ever':207 'exalt':693 'exampl':836 'expect':597 'express':635 'face':178 'fact':181 'fair':453,835 'fairer':505 'faith':102 'fall':224,324,490,511 'fame':256 'famin':129 'far':506 'fate':671 'fear':391 'feast':735 'feign':740 'fell':131,318,322 'find':84,865 'fire':127 'first':764,894 'flatteri':282 'flight':272 'flower':521 'foe':203 'forc':833 'forese':147 'form':451 'forth':27,119,190 'fourscor':191,232 'friend':205,254,343,800 'friendship':6,643,698,866 'fruit':903 'full':357,629 'furi':132 'garland':556 'glad':552,850 'go':382 'good':236,749,843 'got':53,245,905 'great':30,425,746,806 'grew':785 'grow':470 'half':52,666 'hannib':35 'happi':599 'harri':669 'harvest':907 'hast':416 'hastili':58 'head':561 'heart':703,876 'heaven':680 'henri':16 'holi':578 'honest':250 'honor':103,258 'horror':96 'human':377 'hundr':487 'hurl':121 'hurri':118 'immort':3,43 'imperfect':370 'inde':867 'indentur':713 'infant':21,151 'jonson':611 'joy':630 'keep':663 'knit':751 'know':565,766 'last':334,494 'late':217 'law':854 'lay':108 'leap':572 'leas':715 'leav':75 'left':856 'let':548 'life':144,161,293,374,422,459,535 'light':440,523,659,682 'like':154,471,770,776 'lili':500 'line':457,885 'live':420,604,802 'log':492 'long':418,483,650 'look':46,550 'lore':79 'love':744 'lucius':12,543,649 'mad':61 'made':711,762,813 'make':393,455,477 'man':173,478 'mankind':76,859 'manner':755 'maskèd':172 'mass':398 'may':508,536 'meant':632 'measur':163,363,442,534 'memori':4,606 'men':267,277,600,883 'met':133 'might':371,862 'mind':753 'miseri':146,400 'morison':17,317,567,827 'mother':64 'must':685 'n':225 'name':264,696 'natur':89 'nay':564 'never':321 'night':116,515 'nobl':9,263,342,542 'noth':818 'number':364 'oak':485 'offic':350 'one':184,665,700,780 'orgi':736 'outliv':185 'pair':10 'part':244,626 'patriot':339 'peer':187 'pen':878 'perfect':338,537,819 'plant':519,557 'pleasur':725 'poet':591 'portion':787 'possess':576 'practic':847 'present':574 'priest':589 'prodigi':34 'produc':396 'profit':720 'proport':526 'protest':741 'purchas':253 'rage':39,579 'raze':41 'read':863 'recòrd':890 'regard':105 'repeat':408 'rest':622 'return':59,153 'right':107,335 'rime':730 'riot':732 'roll':887 'round':359 'ruin':138 'sack':99 'saguntum':23 'saw':841 'say':592 'schism':645 'sea':291 'season':435 'see':530,581 'separ':656 'sere':498 'set':139 'shame':101 'shine':553,686,690 'short':533 'show':414 'sight':279 'simpl':743 'sir':11,15 'small':525 'soldier':331 'son':348 'sordid':281 'sound':365 'sow':901 'space':166 'spell':427 'sphere':379 'st':62,325 'stage':403 'stand':157,381,482,610,829 'star':701 'state':200 'stirrer':214 'stood':227,329 'stoop':274 'strife':285 'style':792 'sum':70,388 'sung':613 'sunk':287 'sup':303 'surnam':807 'swell':405 'sword':126 'syllab':447 'tarri':654 'tast':624 'tell':385 'th':123 'thee':91,155 'thi':25,63,397,549,560,566 'thin':406 'thine':67 'thing':410 'think':563 'thou':45,50,74,323,415 'though':367 'three':229,486 'thrive':248 'throng':412 'thus':614 'till':783 'time':195,723 'titl':309,809 'told':189 'tongu':327 'tother':782 'town':44 'trampl':109 'tree':473 'troubl':201 'truth':594 'turn':19,238,466,688 'twenti':221 'twi':658 'two':695,880 'union':705 'unto':815 'upon':122 'urg':117 'urn':68 'us':652 'utmost':137 'vain':726 'valu':175 'vexèd':194 'virtu':817 'virtuous':243,347 'water':302 'weari':269 'weight':361 'well':219,241,445 'went':619 'wert':51 'whilst':677 'whole':199 'whose':884 'wine':546 'wise':55 'wiser':88 'womb':66 'word':872 'world':125 'would':152 'written':869 'wrought':433 'year':31,192,395,488 'yet':857 'young':319

Oh, my only light,                       It cannot be                       That I am he          On whom thy tempests fell all night.          These are thy wonders, Lord of love, To make us see we are but flowers that glide;          Which when we once can find and prove, Thou hast a garden for us where to bide;                       Who would be more,                       Swelling through store,          Forfeit their Paradise by their pride.\n	'age':233 'amiss':124 'anger':199 'away':37 'bell':121 'bent':191 'besid':22 'bide':307 'blown':78 'bring':34,103 'bud':235 'burn':217 'cannot':261 'chang':142 'chime':116 'clean':10 'cold':48 'come':200 'could':57,135 'dead':86 'death':240 'declin':203 'demean':25 'depart':68 'dew':250 'dost':220 'doth':168 'even':14 'fair':159 'fast':144 'fell':271 'find':296 'flower':2,17,67,150,170,288 'forfeit':315 'fresh':4 'frost':30,205 'frown':225 'garden':302 'glide':290 'gone':63 'green':60 'grief':35 'groan':165 'grow':163,184 'hard':84 'hast':300 'heart':56 'heaven':110,162,194 'hell':106 'hour':113 'hous':91 'join':179 'keep':90 'kill':100 'late':28 'late-past':27 'least':224 'light':259 'like':38 'line':188 'live':242 'lord':6,97,278 'love':280 'make':114,282 'mani':153,239 'may':41 'melt':36 'mine':196 'mother':73 'mother-root':72 'night':273 'offer':160 'oh':5,137,256 'paradis':147,317 'pass':120 'passing-bel':119 'past':29,141 'pleasur':33 'pole':209 'power':99 'pride':320 'prove':298 'quicken':102 'quit':64 'rain':252 'recov':59 'relish':254 'return':13 'root':74 'say':123 'see':70,284 'shoot':157 'shower':174 'shown':229 'shrivel':55 'sin':176 'smell':248 'snow':39 'spell':136 'spring':19,155,173 'still':189 'store':314 'straight':187 'sweet':8 'swell':312 'tempest':270 'thi':12,95,129,146,198,269,276 'thine':227 'thing':49,216 'thither':166 'thou':219,299 'thought':53 'togeth':81,180 'tribut':31 'turn':221 'underground':65 'unknown':92 'upward':190 'us':283,304 'vers':255 'want':171 'weather':85 'wither':152 'wonder':96,277 'word':130 'world':89 'would':51,309 'write':244 'zone':213
405	The Forerunners	178		\nThe harbingers are come. See, see their mark: White is their color, and behold my head. But must they have my brain? Must they dispark Those sparkling notions, which therein were bred?     Must dullness turn me to a clod? Yet have they left me, Thou art still my God. Good men ye be, to leave me my best room, Ev’n all my heart, and what is lodgèd there:   I pass not, I, what of the rest become, So Thou art still my God be out of fear.     He will be pleasèd with that ditty: And if I please him, I write fine and witty. Farewell sweet phrases, lovely metaphors. But will ye leave me thus? When ye before Of stews and brothels only knew the doors, Then did I wash you with my tears, and more,     Brought you to church well dressed and clad: My God must have my best, ev’n all I had. Lovely enchanting language, sugar-cane, Honey of roses, wither wilt thou fly? Hath some fond lover ’ticed thee to thy bane? And wilt thou leave the church and love a sty?          Fie, thou wilt soil thy broidered coat, And hurt thyself, and him that sings the note. Let foolish lovers, if they will love dung, With canvas, not with arras, clothe their shame: Let folly speak in her own native tongue. True beauty dwells on high: ours is a flame     But borrowed thence to light us thither. Beauty and beauteous words should go together.

For we considered thee as at some six                            Or ten years hence,       After the loss of life and sense, Flesh being turned to dust, and bones to sticks. We looked on this side of thee, shooting short;                          Where we did find       The shells of fledge souls left behind, Dry dust, which sheds no tears, but may extort. But since our Savior’s death did put some blood                            Into thy face,       Thou art grown fair and full of grace, Much in request, much sought for as a good. For we do now behold thee gay and glad,                            As at Doomsday;       When souls shall wear their new array, And all thy bones with beauty shall be clad.

I’m too fond of eggplant ever to be allowed into Heaven But imagine celestial brinjal— aubergines du paradis! ANACHRONISM:          a) homesick for one of              the chief cities of Ohio          b) process for correcting chromatic              aberration in camera and other lenses One of the most wonderful and magical actions We can perform:         Let something alone. Refuse To allow yourself the pleasure of messing it up. The things appear to want adjusting, improving, Cleaning up &c. APPEARS so to us But as a collection of “event particles” A section of the Universe as a noisy morning &c Leave it alone. Don’t tamper with it. Free of that poor-ass Oregon down-home history As this clear water streaming over head eyes face I can see hollyhocks ten feet high sideways To go and to stay illusory I flee pale music                         (I know what I’m doing, NIGHT & DAY) I flee Death’s pale music                                   (Well, what?) Fleeing Death’s proud music, “Get up out of there,” my father used to say, “You can’t sleep your life away. People die in bed.” But I am tired of all the world With notebook and pen I hurl myself deep among The dopey sheets to bed, and lock the gates!

She looks at the moon through that window that you see Over there. She is now a wax dummy with a face That exhibits what the Japanese think of as “refined” Features. All dressed up in Heian court robes Long black hair down her back. In the antechamber A smaller dummy represents girl-child attendant Grinding ink at a large inkstone The figure of Murasaki holds a writing brush And a long piece of paper. Her head has begun to turn Away from the writing to observe the moon And quite likely to remark upon the song of the uguisu Scholars, Japanese and Western, say she never did Never was here a minute. The priest shows A sutra copied out in Murasaki's own handwriting Here's the very inkstone that she used. There is the moonlight window Dog days, ten years, I try to remember your face You disappear, all my head can see Are two paintings and drawings in red ink Whatever else I've done with my life Amounts

408	from Ajax: Dirge	179		\nThe glories of our blood and state Are shadows, not substantial things; There is no armor against fate; Death lays his icy hand on kings.     Scepter and crown     Must tumble down And in the dust be equal made With the poor crooked scythe and spade. Some men with swords may reap the field And plant fresh laurels where they kill, But their strong nerves at last must yield; They tame but one another still.     Early or late     They stoop to fate And must give up their murmuring breath, When they, pale captives, creep to death. The garlands wither on your brow, Then boast no more your mighty deeds; Upon death’s purple altar now See where the victor-victim bleeds.     Your heads must come     To the cold tomb; Only the actions of the just Smell sweet and blossom in their dust.\n	'action':135 'ajax':2 'altar':116 'anoth':76 'armor':19 'bleed':124 'blood':8 'blossom':142 'boast':106 'breath':91 'brow':104 'captiv':95 'cold':131 'come':128 'creep':96 'crook':45 'crown':31 'death':22,98,113 'deed':111 'dirg':3 'dust':38,145 'earli':78 'equal':40 'fate':21,84 'field':56 'fresh':59 'garland':100 'give':87 'glori':5 'hand':26 'head':126 'ici':25 'kill':63 'king':28 'last':69 'late':80 'laurel':60 'lay':23 'made':41 'may':53 'men':50 'mighti':110 'murmur':90 'must':32,70,86,127 'nerv':67 'one':75 'pale':94 'plant':58 'poor':44 'purpl':115 'reap':54 'scepter':29 'scyth':46 'see':118 'shadow':12 'smell':139 'spade':48 'state':10 'still':77 'stoop':82 'strong':66 'substanti':14 'sweet':140 'sword':52 'tame':73 'thing':15 'tomb':132 'tumbl':33 'upon':112 'victim':123 'victor':122 'victor-victim':121 'wither':101 'yield':71

412	Upon My Lady Carlisle’s Walking in Hampton Court Garden	181		\nDIALOGUE\r        T.C.       J.S.\rThom. Didst thou not find the place inspired,\rAnd flowers, as if they had desired\rNo other sun, start from their beds,\rAnd for a sight steal out their heads?\rHeardst thou not music when she talked?\rAnd didst not find that as she walked\rShe threw rare perfumes all about,\rSuch as bean-blossoms newly out,\rOr chafèd spices give?—\rJ.S. I must confess those perfumes, Tom,\rI did not smell; nor found that from\rHer passing by ought sprung up new.\rThe flowers had all their birth from you;\rFor I passed o’er the self-same walk\rAnd did not find one single stalk\rOf anything that was to bring\rThis unknown after-after-spring.\rThom. Dull and insensible, couldst see\rA thing so near a deity\rMove up and down, and feel no change?\rJ.S. None, and so great, were alike strange;\rI had my thoughts, but not your way.\rAll are not born, sir, to the bay.\rAlas! Tom, I am flesh and blood,\rAnd was consulting how I could\rIn spite of masks and hoods descry\rThe parts denied unto the eye.\rI was undoing all she wore,\rAnd had she walked but one turn more,\rEve in her first state had not been\rMore naked or more plainly seen.\rThom. ’Twas well for thee she left the place;\rThere is great danger in that face.\rBut hadst thou viewed her leg and thigh,\rAnd upon that discovery\rSearched after parts that are more dear\r(As fancy seldom stops so near),\rNo time or age had ever seen\rSo lost a thing as thou hadst been.\n	'after-after-spr':131 'age':277 'ala':179 'alik':161 'anyth':124 'bay':178 'bean':68 'bean-blossom':67 'bed':35 'birth':103 'blood':185 'blossom':69 'born':174 'bring':128 'carlisl':4 'chafèd':73 'chang':154 'confess':79 'consult':188 'could':191 'couldst':139 'court':9 'danger':245 'dear':267 'deiti':146 'deni':201 'descri':198 'desir':28 'dialogu':11 'didst':15,52 'discoveri':260 'dull':136 'er':110 'eve':219 'ever':279 'eye':204 'face':248 'fanci':269 'feel':152 'find':18,54,119 'first':222 'flesh':183 'flower':23,99 'found':88 'garden':10 'give':75 'great':159,244 'hadst':250,287 'hampton':8 'head':43 'heardst':44 'hood':197 'insens':138 'inspir':21 'j.s':13,76,155 'ladi':3 'left':239 'leg':254 'lost':282 'mask':195 'move':147 'music':47 'must':78 'nake':228 'near':144,273 'new':97 'newli':70 'none':156 'o':109 'one':120,216 'ought':94 'part':200,263 'pass':92,108 'perfum':62,81 'place':20,241 'plain':231 'rare':61 'search':261 'see':140 'seen':232,280 'seldom':270 'self':113 'self-sam':112 'sight':39 'singl':121 'sir':175 'smell':86 'spice':74 'spite':193 'spring':134 'sprung':95 'stalk':122 'start':32 'state':223 'steal':40 'stop':271 'strang':162 'sun':31 't.c':12 'talk':50 'thee':237 'thigh':256 'thing':142,284 'thom':14,135,233 'thou':16,45,251,286 'thought':166 'threw':60 'time':275 'tom':82,180 'turn':217 'twas':234 'undo':207 'unknown':130 'unto':202 'upon':1,258 'view':252 'walk':6,58,115,214 'way':170 'well':235 'wore':210

415	The Tear	182		\nWhat bright soft thing is this?     Sweet Mary, the fair eyes’ expense?     A moist spark it is,     A wat’ry diamond; from whence The very term, I think, was found The water of a diamond.     O ’tis not a tear,  ’Tis a star about to drop From thine eye its sphere;    The sun will stoop and take it up. Proud will his sister be to wear This thine eyes’ jewel in her ear.     O ’tis a tear  Too true a tear; for no sad eyne,     How sad so e’re,  Rain so true a teare as thine; Each drop leaving a place so dear, Weeps for itself, is its own tear.     Such a pearl as this is,    (Slipped from Aurora’s dewy breast) The rose bud’s sweet lip kisses;    And such the rose itself, when vexed With ungentle flames, does shed, Sweating in too warm a bed.     Such the maiden gem,    By the wanton spring put on, Peeps from her parent stem,    And blushes on the manly sun: This wat’ry blossom of thy eyne, Ripe, will make the richer wine.     Faire drop, why quak’st thou so?  ’Cause thou straight must lay thy head     In the dust? o no;    The dust shall never be thy bed: A pillow for thee will I bring, Stuffed with down of angels’ wing.     Thus carried up on high,  (For to Heaven thou must go)     Sweetly shalt thou lie  And in soft slumbers bathe thy woe; Till the singing orbs awake thee, And one of their bright chorus make thee.     There thy self shalt be  An eye, but not a weeping one,     Yet I doubt of thee,  Whether th’hadst rather there have shone An eye of Heaven; or still shine here, In th’Heaven of Mary’s eye, a tear.\n	'angel':222 'aurora':122 'awak':250 'bath':243 'bed':150,210 'blossom':175 'blush':167 'breast':125 'bright':4,256 'bring':217 'bud':128 'carri':225 'caus':192 'chorus':257 'dear':106 'dewi':124 'diamond':23,37 'doubt':274 'drop':48,101,186 'dust':201,205 'e':91 'ear':75 'expens':14 'eye':13,51,71,266,285,298 'eyn':87,178 'fair':12,185 'flame':142 'found':32 'gem':154 'go':234 'hadst':279 'head':198 'heaven':231,287,294 'high':228 'jewel':72 'kiss':132 'lay':196 'leav':102 'lie':238 'lip':131 'maiden':153 'make':181,258 'man':170 'mari':10,296 'moist':16 'must':195,233 'never':207 'o':38,76,202 'one':253,271 'orb':249 'parent':164 'pearl':116 'peep':161 'pillow':212 'place':104 'proud':62 'put':159 'quak':188 'rain':93 'rather':280 're':92 'richer':183 'ripe':179 'rose':127,136 'ry':22,174 'sad':86,89 'self':262 'shall':206 'shalt':236,263 'shed':144 'shine':290 'shone':283 'sing':248 'sister':65 'slip':120 'slumber':242 'soft':5,241 'spark':17 'sphere':53 'spring':158 'st':189 'star':45 'stem':165 'still':289 'stoop':57 'straight':194 'stuf':218 'sun':55,171 'sweat':145 'sweet':9,130,235 'take':59 'tear':2,42,79,83,97,113,300 'term':28 'th':278,293 'thee':214,251,259,276 'thi':177,197,209,244,261 'thine':50,70,99 'thing':6 'think':30 'thou':190,193,232,237 'thus':224 'till':246 'tis':39,43,77 'true':81,95 'ungentl':141 'vex':139 'wanton':157 'warm':148 'wat':21,173 'water':34 'wear':68 'weep':107,270 'whenc':25 'whether':277 'wine':184 'wing':223 'woe':245 'yet':272

417	The Grasshopper	184		\nO thou that swing’st upon the waving hair    Of some well-fillèd oaten beard, Drunk every night with a delicious tear    Dropped thee from heaven, where now th’ art reared; The joys of earth and air are thine entire,    That with thy feet and wings dost hop and fly; And, when thy poppy works, thou dost retire    To thy carved acorn-bed to lie. Up with the day, the sun thou welcom’st then,    Sport’st in the gilt-plats of his beams, And all these merry days mak’st merry men,    Thyself, and melancholy streams. But ah, the sickle! Golden ears are cropped;    Ceres and Bacchus bid good night; Sharp, frosty fingers all your flowers have topped,    And what scythes spared, winds shave off quite. Poor verdant fool, and now green ice! thy joys,    Large and as lasting as thy perch of grass, Bid us lay in ’gainst winter rain, and poise    Their floods with an o’erflowing glass. Thou best of men and friends! we will create    A genuine summer in each other’s breast, And spite of this cold time and frozen fate,    Thaw us a warm seat to our rest. Our sacred hearths shall burn eternally,    As vestal flames; the North Wind, he Shall strike his frost-stretched wings, dissolve, and fly    This Etna in epitome. Dropping December shall come weeping in,    Bewail th’usurping of his reign: But when in showers of old Greek we begin,    Shall cry he hath his crown again! Night, as clear Hesper, shall our tapers whip    From the light casements where we play, And the dark hag from her black mantle strip,    And stick there everlasting day. Thus richer than untempted kings are we,    That, asking nothing, nothing need: Though lords of all what seas embrace, yet he    That wants himself is poor indeed.\n	'acorn':66 'acorn-b':65 'ah':104 'air':40 'art':33 'ask':293 'bacchus':113 'beam':89 'beard':18 'bed':67 'begin':248 'best':168 'bewail':234 'bid':114,151 'black':277 'breast':183 'burn':205 'carv':64 'casement':267 'cere':111 'clear':258 'cold':188 'come':231 'creat':175 'cri':250 'crop':110 'crown':254 'dark':273 'day':73,94,284 'decemb':229 'delici':24 'dissolv':221 'dost':50,60 'drop':26,228 'drunk':19 'ear':108 'earth':38 'embrac':303 'entir':43 'epitom':227 'erflow':165 'etern':206 'etna':225 'everi':20 'everlast':283 'fate':192 'feet':47 'fillèd':16 'finger':119 'flame':209 'fli':53,223 'flood':161 'flower':122 'fool':135 'friend':172 'frost':218 'frost-stretch':217 'frosti':118 'frozen':191 'gainst':155 'genuin':177 'gilt':85 'gilt-plat':84 'glass':166 'golden':107 'good':115 'grass':150 'grasshopp':2 'greek':246 'green':138 'hag':274 'hair':11 'hath':252 'hearth':203 'heaven':29 'hesper':259 'hop':51 'ice':139 'inde':311 'joy':36,141 'king':289 'larg':142 'last':145 'lay':153 'lie':69 'light':266 'lord':298 'mak':95 'mantl':278 'melancholi':101 'men':98,170 'merri':93,97 'need':296 'night':21,116,256 'north':211 'noth':294,295 'o':3,164 'oaten':17 'old':245 'perch':148 'plat':86 'play':270 'pois':159 'poor':133,310 'poppi':57 'quit':132 'rain':157 'rear':34 'reign':239 'rest':200 'retir':61 'richer':286 'sacr':202 'scyth':127 'sea':302 'seat':197 'shall':204,214,230,249,260 'sharp':117 'shave':130 'shower':243 'sickl':106 'spare':128 'spite':185 'sport':80 'st':7,78,81,96 'stick':281 'stream':102 'stretch':219 'strike':215 'strip':279 'summer':178 'sun':75 'swing':6 'taper':262 'tear':25 'th':32,235 'thaw':193 'thee':27 'thi':46,56,63,140,147 'thine':42 'thou':4,59,76,167 'though':297 'thus':285 'thyself':99 'time':189 'top':124 'untempt':288 'upon':8 'us':152,194 'usurp':236 'verdant':134 'vestal':208 'want':307 'warm':196 'wave':10 'weep':232 'welcom':77 'well':15 'well-fillèd':14 'whip':263 'wind':129,212 'wing':49,220 'winter':156 'work':58 'yet':304

423	Burial Rites	188		\nEveryone comes back here to die as I will soon. The place feels right since it’s half dead to begin with. Even on a rare morning of rain, like this morning, with the low sky hoarding its riches except for a few mock tears, the hard ground accepts nothing. Six years ago I buried my mother’s ashes beside a young lilac that’s now taller than I, and stuck the stub of a rosebush into her dirt, where like everything else not human it thrives. The small blossoms never unfurl; whatever they know they keep to themselves until a morning rain or a night wind pares the petals down to nothing. Even the neighbor cat who shits daily on the paths and then hides deep in the jungle of the weeds refuses to purr. Whatever’s here is just here, and nowhere else, so it’s right to end up beside the woman who bore me, to shovel into the dirt whatever’s left and leave only a name for some- one who wants it. Think of it, my name, no longer a portion of me, no longer inflated or bruised, no longer stewing in a rich compost of memory or the simpler one of bone shards, dirt, kitty litter, wood ashes, the roots of the eucalyptus I planted in ’73, a tiny me taking nothing, giving nothing, and free at last.\n	'73':225 'accept':51 'ago':55 'ash':61,216 'back':5 'begin':23 'besid':62,155 'blossom':92 'bone':210 'bore':159 'bruis':195 'buri':57 'burial':1 'cat':119 'come':4 'compost':202 'daili':122 'dead':21 'deep':129 'die':8 'dirt':81,165,212 'els':85,147 'end':153 'eucalyptus':221 'even':25,116 'everyon':3 'everyth':84 'except':42 'feel':15 'free':234 'give':231 'ground':50 'half':20 'hard':49 'hide':128 'hoard':39 'human':87 'inflat':193 'jungl':132 'keep':99 'kitti':213 'know':97 'last':236 'leav':170 'left':168 'like':32,83 'lilac':65 'litter':214 'longer':186,192,197 'low':37 'memori':204 'mock':46 'morn':29,34,104 'mother':59 'name':173,184 'neighbor':118 'never':93 'night':108 'noth':52,115,230,232 'nowher':146 'one':176,208 'pare':110 'path':125 'petal':112 'place':14 'plant':223 'portion':188 'purr':138 'rain':31,105 'rare':28 'refus':136 'rich':41,201 'right':16,151 'rite':2 'root':218 'rosebush':78 'shard':211 'shit':121 'shovel':162 'simpler':207 'sinc':17 'six':53 'sky':38 'small':91 'soon':12 'stew':198 'stub':75 'stuck':73 'take':229 'taller':69 'tear':47 'think':180 'thrive':89 'tini':227 'unfurl':94 'want':178 'weed':135 'whatev':95,139,166 'wind':109 'woman':157 'wood':215 'year':54 'young':64

425	Midsummer	190		\nOn nights like this we used to swim in the quarry,  the boys making up games requiring them to tear off  the girls’ clothes  and the girls cooperating, because they had new bodies since last summer and they wanted to exhibit them, the brave ones  leaping off  the high rocks — bodies crowding the water. The nights were humid, still. The stone was cool and wet, marble for  graveyards, for buildings that we never saw,  buildings in cities far away. On cloudy nights, you were blind. Those nights the rocks were dangerous,  but in another way it was all dangerous, that was what we were after.  The summer started. Then the boys and girls began to pair off  but always there were a few left at the end — sometimes they’d keep watch, sometimes they’d pretend to go off  with each other like the rest, but what could they do there, in the woods? No one wanted to be them.  But they’d show up anyway, as though some night their luck would change,  fate would be a different fate. At the beginning and at the end, though, we were all together. After the evening chores, after the smaller children were in bed,  then we were free. Nobody said anything, but we knew the nights we’d meet  and the nights we wouldn’t. Once or twice, at the end of summer,  we could see a baby was going to come out of all that kissing. And for those two, it was terrible, as terrible as being alone.  The game was over. We’d sit on the rocks smoking cigarettes,  worrying about the ones who weren’t there. And then finally walk home through the fields,  because there was always work the next day.  And the next day, we were kids again, sitting on the front steps in the morning,  eating a peach.  Just that, but it seemed an honor to have a mouth.  And then going to work, which meant helping out in the fields.  One boy worked for an old lady, building shelves.  The house was very old, maybe built when the mountain was built. And then the day faded. We were dreaming, waiting for night.  Standing at the front door at twilight, watching the shadows lengthen.  And a voice in the kitchen was always complaining about the heat, wanting the heat to break. Then the heat broke, the night was clear.  And you thought of  the boy or girl you’d be meeting later.  And you thought of  walking into the woods and lying down,  practicing all those things you were learning in the water.  And though sometimes you couldn’t see the person you were with, there was no substitute for that person. The summer night glowed; in the field, fireflies were glinting. And for those who understood such things, the stars were sending messages:  You will leave the village where you were born  and in another country you’ll become very rich, very powerful, but always you will mourn something you left behind, even though  you can’t say what it was, and eventually you will return to seek it.\n	'alon':259 'alway':120,291,388,502 'anoth':95,492 'anyth':211 'anyway':167 'away':80 'babi':238 'becom':496 'bed':204 'began':115 'begin':184 'behind':509 'blind':86 'bodi':34,52 'born':489 'boy':14,112,339,411 'brave':45 'break':397 'broke':401 'build':71,76,345 'built':353,358 'chang':175 'children':201 'chore':197 'cigarett':271 'citi':78 'clear':405 'cloth':25 'cloudi':82 'come':242 'complain':389 'cool':64 'cooper':29 'could':149,235 'couldn':444 'countri':493 'crowd':53 'd':131,136,164,218,265,415 'danger':92,100 'day':295,299,362 'differ':180 'door':374 'dream':366 'eat':312 'end':128,188,231 'even':196,510 'eventu':520 'exhibit':42 'fade':363 'far':79 'fate':176,181 'field':287,337,465 'final':282 'firefli':466 'free':208 'front':307,373 'game':17,261 'girl':24,28,114,413 'glint':468 'glow':462 'go':139,240,328 'graveyard':69 'heat':392,395,400 'help':333 'high':50 'home':284 'honor':321 'hous':348 'humid':59 'keep':132 'kid':302 'kiss':247 'kitchen':386 'knew':214 'ladi':344 'last':36 'later':418 'leap':47 'learn':436 'leav':483 'left':125,508 'lengthen':380 'lie':428 'like':4,144 'll':495 'luck':173 'make':15 'marbl':67 'mayb':352 'meant':332 'meet':219,417 'messag':480 'midsumm':1 'morn':311 'mountain':356 'mourn':505 'mouth':325 'never':74 'new':33 'next':294,298 'night':3,57,83,88,171,216,222,369,403,461 'nobodi':209 'old':343,351 'one':46,157,275,338 'pair':117 'peach':314 'person':448,458 'power':500 'practic':430 'pretend':137 'quarri':12 'requir':18 'rest':146 'return':523 'rich':498 'rock':51,90,269 'said':210 'saw':75 'say':515 'see':236,446 'seek':525 'seem':319 'send':479 'shadow':379 'shelv':346 'show':165 'sinc':35 'sit':266,304 'smaller':200 'smoke':270 'someth':506 'sometim':129,134,442 'stand':370 'star':477 'start':109 'step':308 'still':60 'stone':62 'substitut':455 'summer':37,108,233,460 'swim':9 'tear':21 'terribl':254,256 'thing':433,475 'though':169,189,441,511 'thought':408,421 'togeth':193 'twice':228 'twilight':376 'two':251 'understood':473 'use':7 'villag':485 'voic':383 'wait':367 'walk':283,423 'want':40,158,393 'watch':133,377 'water':55,439 'way':96 'weren':277 'wet':66 'wood':155,426 'work':292,330,340 'worri':272 'would':174,177 'wouldn':224
426	Dawn	190		\n1 Child waking up in a dark room  screaming I want my duck back, I want my duck back  in a language nobody understands in the least — There is no duck.

But the duck — no one knows what happened to that.                                   2 They’ve  just met, now  they’re sleeping near an open window. Partly to wake them, to assure them  that what they remember of  the night is correct,  now light needs to enter the room, also to show them the context in which this occurred:  socks half  hidden under a dirty mat,  quilt decorated with green leaves — the sunlight specifying  these but not other objects,  setting boundaries, sure of  itself, not arbitrary, then lingering, describing  each thing in detail,  fastidious, like a composition in English,  even a little blood on the sheets —                                   3 Afterward, they separate for the day.  Even later, at a desk, in the market,  the manager not satisfied with the figures he’s given,  the berries moldy under the topmost layer — so that one withdraws from the world even as one continues to take action in it — You get home, that’s when you notice the mold.

430	Stemming  from Stevens	194		\nIt’s not enough to cover the rock with leaves  — as if  vernal fluidities could be enough for the stern assault of  fact. As if  a living ornament, light and subject to temporal  breezes, could be enough to overcome despair, that chunk of  something solid in the air, unmoving, as words repeated are. It’s not enough to cover despair with motion. Motion itself  is flawed, continuous motion a narrow, thin escape from what is rooted. Leaves do sway, but in truth, they’re only flapping out, ancillary, uncertain, buffeted this way and that.

431	Ladybirds	195		\nBrilliance is a carcass on a snow-white beach. Envy never sleeps. I tell my children truthfully: a long red beard is breaking from the darkness scale. He’s chasing you because you’re new. Because he’s old and sees the town in dirty tones: violet sheep and wine-dark corn.

432	Rose Thorns	196		\nWhy do roses need their thorns?  Some things are little known.  But thorns of roses  spring and seize the surface  of  fey airs  before the roses come.  I’ve seen thorns huddle in a harmony alone, hunkered down on green, wiry canes,  smoothed blades of whipping rose stalks,  and curl their polished tridents  to night’s call.  They are like stars  digging into firmament  with such desire, you don’t quite get it,  and so healthy that  they almost have to wound,  or like bodies that can’t be argued,  borrowed, tamed.

445	Dear Mr. Fanelli,	201		\nI saw your picture in the 79th street station. You said you’d be interested in any comments I might have on the condition of the station Mr. Fanelli, there is a lot of debris in the 79th street station that makes it unpleasant to wait in for more than a few minutes. The station could use a paint job and maybe new speakers so you could understand the delay announcements that are always being broadcast. Mr. Fanelli—there are a lot of people sleeping in the 79th street station & it makes me sad to think they have no home to go to. Mr. Fanelli, do you think you could find a more comfortable place for them to rest? It’s pretty noisy in the subway, especially all those express trains hurtling through every few minutes, anyway when the trains are in service. I have to admit, Mr. Fanelli, I think the 79th street station’s in pretty bad shape & sometimes at night as I toss in my bed I think the world’s not doing too good either, & I wonder what’s going to happen, where we’re headed, if we’re headed anywhere, if we even have heads. Mr. Fanelli, do you think if we could just start with the 79th street station & do what we could with that then maybe we could, you know, I guess, move on from there? Mr. Fanelli, when I saw your picture & the sign asking for suggestions I thought, if you really wanted to get to the bottom of what’s wrong then maybe it was my job to write to you: Maybe you’ve never been inside the 79th street station because you’re so busy managing the 72nd street & 66th street stations, maybe you don’t know the problems we have at 79th—I mean the dirt & frequent delays & the feeling of total misery that pervades the place. Mr. Fanelli, are you reading this far in the letter or do you get so many letters every day that you don’t have time to give each one the close attention it desires? Or am I the only person who’s taken up your invitation to get in touch & you just don’t have enough experience to know how to respond? I’m sorry I can’t get your attention Mr. Fanelli because I really believe if you ask for comments then you ought to be willing to act on them—even if ought is too big a word to throw around at this point. Mr. Fanelli I hope you won’t think I’m rude if I ask you a personal question. Do you get out of the office much? Do you go to the movies or do you prefer sports—or maybe quiet evenings at a local restaurant? Do you read much, Mr. Fanelli? I don’t mean just Gibbons and like that, but philosophy— have you read much Hanna Arendt or do you prefer a more ideological perspective? I think if I understood where you are coming from, Mr. Fanelli, I could write to you more cogently, more persuasively. Mr. Fanelli, do you get out of the city at all—I mean like up to Bear Mountain or out to Montauk? I mean do you notice how unpleasant the air is in the 79th street station—that we could use some cooling or air-filtering system down there? Mr. Fanelli, do you think it’s possible we could get together and talk about these things in person? There are a few other points I’d like to go over with you if I could get the chance. Things I’d like to talk to you about but that I’d be reluctant to put down on paper. Mr. Fanelli, I haven’t been feeling very good lately and I thought meeting with you face to face might change my mood, might put me into a new frame of mind. Maybe we could have lunch? Or maybe after work? Think about it, Mr. Fanelli.\n	'66th':293 '72nd':291 '79th':10,41,91,156,216,281,306,559 'act':411 'admit':150 'air':555,570 'air-filt':569 'alway':77 'announc':74 'anyway':140 'anywher':198 'arendt':495 'around':424 'ask':246,401,441 'attent':353,392 'bad':162 'bear':541 'bed':172 'believ':398 'big':419 'bottom':259 'broadcast':79 'busi':288 'chanc':613 'chang':654 'citi':533 'close':352 'cogent':522 'come':512 'comfort':117 'comment':21,403 'condit':27 'cool':567 'could':59,70,113,211,222,228,517,564,584,610,668 'd':16,601,616,626 'day':340 'dear':1 'debri':38 'delay':73,312 'desir':355 'dirt':310 'either':182 'enough':377 'especi':130 'even':201,414,468 'everi':137,339 'experi':378 'express':133 'face':650,652 'fanelli':3,32,81,108,152,205,238,323,394,429,478,515,526,576,635,679 'far':328 'feel':314,640 'filter':571 'find':114 'frame':663 'frequent':311 'get':256,335,369,390,448,529,585,611 'gibbon':484 'give':348 'go':105,187,456,604 'good':181,642 'guess':232 'hanna':494 'happen':189 'haven':637 'head':193,197,203 'home':103 'hope':431 'hurtl':135 'ideolog':502 'insid':279 'interest':18 'invit':367 'job':63,269 'know':230,300,380 'late':643 'letter':331,338 'like':486,538,602,617 'local':471 'lot':36,85 'lunch':670 'm':385,437 'make':45,95 'manag':289 'mani':337 'mayb':65,226,265,274,296,466,666,672 'mean':308,482,537,548 'meet':647 'might':23,653,657 'mind':665 'minut':56,139 'miseri':317 'montauk':546 'mood':656 'mountain':542 'move':233 'movi':459 'mr':2,31,80,107,151,204,237,322,393,428,477,514,525,575,634,678 'much':453,476,493 'never':277 'new':66,662 'night':166 'noisi':126 'notic':551 'offic':452 'one':350 'ought':406,416 'paint':62 'paper':633 'peopl':87 'person':361,444,593 'perspect':503 'persuas':524 'pervad':319 'philosophi':489 'pictur':7,243 'place':118,321 'point':427,599 'possibl':582 'prefer':463,499 'pretti':125,161 'problem':302 'put':630,658 'question':445 'quiet':467 're':192,196,286 'read':326,475,492 'realli':253,397 'reluct':628 'respond':383 'rest':122 'restaur':472 'rude':438 'sad':97 'said':14 'saw':5,241 'servic':146 'shape':163 'sign':245 'sleep':88 'sometim':164 'sorri':386 'speaker':67 'sport':464 'start':213 'station':12,30,43,58,93,158,218,283,295,561 'street':11,42,92,157,217,282,292,294,560 'subway':129 'suggest':248 'system':572 'taken':364 'talk':588,619 'thing':591,614 'think':99,111,154,174,208,435,505,579,675 'thought':250,646 'throw':423 'time':346 'togeth':586 'toss':169 'total':316 'touch':371 'train':134,143 'understand':71 'understood':508 'unpleas':47,553 'use':60,565 've':276 'wait':49 'want':254 'will':409 'won':433 'wonder':184 'word':421 'work':674 'world':176 'write':271,518 'wrong':263

449	Medley of the Cut	107		\nThe column of the commander yielded to our first sweep.\rEven the water jar for our diggers we set on the south wall\rof the general’s tomb without knowing it. So we began.\rHis armies retook Nubia, Libya, and the Levant,\rlost under the sway-bellied lantern-jawed Sun King.\rOverseer of all scribes, Overseer of the priests of Horus,\rGrain-giver to all lands, Royal chief of staff, Regent,\rthe general had himself carried on his palanquin\rthrough the wailing processions\rto oversee the work on this place. And so carved, thus:\rone of his men punches a Nubian in the face.\rThe general was low-born; everything had counted\rand he knew what counted most.\rHis platoons lift open palms towards Tutankhamun.\rThe general towers as a sway-girdled go-between at court\rfor beseeching Libyans.\rOnly the pearl-handled revolvers do not figure here,\ror the comeback challenge Nuts! in the Ardennes winter forest.\rHe had himself carried beyond the busy streets of the dead\rin the city of the dead sloping back from the bluff\rto a higher, private terrace looking across to Memphis.\rBut then he rose to Pharaoh. So he is not here. Instead\rhis first wife lay here, and then his queen also.\rAt his own royal tomb in the Valley, where the designs\rremained uncarved, sketching idea along stone,\rhe does not rest either. The fine picklock hand\rgot past Anubis and the reared serpents, and got to him,\rthe Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt. It got past Truth\rwith her high feather, which moved at the slightest disturbance.\rThe general did deep obeisance to her. He is not here.\rWhat at last moves the heart?\rSo much already moved, even in his own century,\rarchitects prying loose mud bricks of the core for new tombs.\rCult funded in perpetuity gone in two generations.\rSo Coleridge, who was indisposed that day, prudently\rremained in the circle of lime trees while his friends went off\ron their walk through the countryside. He followed them in his mind.\rThat way no one would have to dismantle Horeheb’s outer court\rto secure bricks for the statuary room, and facing stones.\rHe cast his mind outward, a net over his dear ones,\rsending them at pace through the middle distance of steeples,\rhill lines, and the murder of Lamb’s mother by his sister,\ra brief madness, thus through the appropriately middle distance\rwhere such things are built and performed in fact, no closer, no farther,\rthen on out to the cleansing rim of apocalypse, evening\rin the bath of waning fire, one bird stitching\rthe whole veil of showings tight along its upper hem—\rthough he was not there, he could tell them that none the less\rhe was next to his words and his word was with them, even\runto the rim of their wandering and their turning back.\rOne dome of air and fire. But he was not there. Nor I here.\rWhat removes the heart from what moves it?\rAs if I were the lecturer before a congress of doctors,\rhis clinching point approaching, when suddenly he stared out\rin silence, and at last said, Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues,\rthe only thing I can see at this moment inside my brain,\rsuch as it is, is a little white mouse chasing a little white ball.

450	A Twenty-fourth Poem about Horses	107		\nSteed out of my dusk and a dusk, now, for the species,\rveins deltawise down your silky inner thigh,\rveins trickling from one eye down the roan cliffside\rof a nose vaulted and chanceled for winds of the Pleistocene,\ryou have come, you paw patiently, that is the main thing,\rthe fields between stretch wider and we, the restless, are everywhere\rsave where your nostril quivers, arches, and you snort in the night.\rWe who debouch into all places dream of you now nowhere.\rYou come to a woman’s hand: that smile. You come to a\rchild’s hand, giggling and shivers. Your hot breath pleasures soldiers.\rHarnessed to caisson with bannered coffin, to the barouche\rat a state wedding, you are ambassador from the eldest  kingdom.\rThe King of Brazil sent a forest of teak to pave the streets\rgirdling the Pantheon, to muffle the clatter you hauled there.\rWhen we spurred you against Wellington’s infantry squares,\ryou side-ran them or reared back. The god of catasrophes took note.\rSad banner you were in the prophecies of Sweet Medicine,\rthe whiskered whitneys bringing and spawning your manes and tails\ramong the Arapaho, Cheyenne, Lakota, Kiowa,\ryour speed between their loins a drumming into decline.\rUnder Tutankhamun, the generalissimo who rode you hummed\rhis tenth title: Overseer of Works in the Hill of Gritstone,\rwhile there in those Works among the pulling men pulled also\ryour brother, sent down because of a freakish temperament.\rMuir knew you on both shores, and van der Post knew you,\rmufti lords recognizing a lord in service. Nuzzle them both.\rThey say that Poseidon at Onchestos, breaking you as a colt,\rhad your driver leap off where the road entered forest,\rand watched to see what you’d do, the rig rattling--smash it\ragainst the trunks on the run, or walk it through tall shadows.\rWhere you linger for shade on the veldt, branches level,\ra tree is the only tree. Your water, the only water.\rFlickers of hair along your neck’s crest release\rthe only signal. Which staggers from storm cloud to browse oats.\rStubby melted candle, your recessed phallus makes\rno howitzer but glistens a coat whose sheen ripples off.\rFor I imagine that Li Ho, seeing good men misused\ras you were, foresaw your withdrawal from our night grasses.\rFor your standing here re-ordains neither Akhilleus\rnor Cuchulain. Dew braids your mane with fresh constellations.\rFor what shall we make of you, made into goddess, mare\rsacrificed but receiving cult also among the footloose\ron the steppes: mother ridden by god-spear, great mam thus\rcaptured, cinched, spurred? though your flanks shudder unfettered.\rThrough mists we flash bits of mirror, but from them\ryou pound abreast, neither parent, eyes orbing the two sides.\rFor that demigod’s eye, tiding, capsizes anyone\rwho would turn trainer. And this one goes on into the bond.\rA trainer aims at one thing, but what tingles him is force\rhinting at the uncontainable, the opponent.\rAnd the top tamers, spook-soothers, the whisperers,\rwill write their books but miss the appointment. It is not inscribed.\rThe two  grooms beside you in Hokusai’s whitewater cascade\rlave you with splashes of it, currying your bulk,\rhoisting your nosebag--and no one has set the timer, everywhere\rit is one sound, stampede steadied and rocking in it.\rYour great-grandparents, unicorn wild asses\rfrom Persia and Scythia, fostered childbirth but also pissed plagues,\rthe unharnessable summum totium browsing in ocean,\ran eye-spangled three-legged mountain. Hell and cloud in your seed!\rIt was your miniature stature at the beginning, Maria Tallchief\rat ten, that wedged you between giants into the straightaway.\rAnd the reindeer modeled from smudge in the Font de Gaume grotto\rat Les Eyzies, fading across your body, trails a third antler\rlike a skater’s scarf through your head, broadening out,\ra dancer’s arm rippling after the total gather.\rLooking back from the pass at his mounted escorts, flashing them\rthree turns back down the corkscrew, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama\rsaw them slumped on your back, the red of Rahu in splashes\rand trickling stillness. And dripping you still awaited their nudges.\rIn that patience, the kernel of the twister moan-lifting\rover Kansas, the shrapnel clatter of your take-off.\rAcross that aftermath, bubbling through wind-sound or the mind’s\rrise from its cringe, the flubber-flutter of moody-moodlessness.\rSo the unforeseen from you opposes the blindly seen in us--\ryour fuse as a spurter, jump-taker, yet a curb also\rto our unsnaffled berserkness.  For the berserking Greek says\rthat only that ass’s horn or hoof, cut off and cupped upward,\rcan hold any of the cold torrent under the world,\rimplacable Styx, All else, graces or muons, it crumbles.\rAnd every jot which that flow dissolves, the images\rwith their assessors, has rolled in us. And you have stood\rcalmly beside us, your shot breath a bloom in the cold,\ryour hooves hammers yet also the last and only chalice.\rThe unreached-for cup, beaker for world-toxin,\rbreast englobing ground zero. And so we know you not.\rAnd I realize: though I have walked drenched in spring rains\rmy bare thighs have not hugged your warm bellows in a downpour.\rFor though your manic tribe is mine, the boreal chargers,\rmere rooms, a migrant’s mangy stations, have detained me.\rFor while historians of cultures hot on the spoor of roots among\rtheir root clans have heard you drum past, they looked up only briefly.\rFor though engravers assumed you would stay, given their way with your\rmusculature, accoutrements, wavy harness, tip-toe grooms,\rgear draped over your cruppers like an evening gown, its ratios\rand metalwork continuous with Genghis Khan’s and a jockey’s,\rtheir inky mastery frames cosily misleading questions:\rwhich posthouse this evening, what pasture tomorrow?\rWhereas you inquire into rupture and the unfenced: what thunder\rbetween flesh and ground, what surge from the cells even past sundown?\n	'abreast':471 'accoutr':972 'across':652,742 'aftermath':744 'aim':501

Will rise, a ghost of memory, if Ever again my handkerchief Is scented with White Heliotrope.\n	'ach':78 'awak':59 'bed':9 'chair':15 'dare':84 'deep':42,44 'dread':82 'dress':56 'drowsili':71 'ever':94 'eye':62,73 'face':38 'feverish':4 'flung':18 'forgotten':49 'ghost':90 'grace':52 'hair':25 'hair-pin':24 'half':20,55,58 'half-open':19 'handkerchief':97 'hat':23 'heliotrop':2,102 'hope':86 'keep':48 'memori':50,92 'mirror':33 'mysteri':47 'nay':83 'need':80 'novel':17 'one':81,85 'open':21 'paint':29 'pin':26 'puff':27 'rise':88 'room':5 'scent':99 'secret':41 'skirt':12 'slant':61 'slept':76 'spread':31 'strang':63 'suck':36 'tumbl':11 'upon':13 'watch':64,69 'white':1,8,101

The jealous Father thought he well might spare All further jealous Care. And, as he walk’d, t’himself alone he smiled, To think how Venus’ Arts he had beguil’d;          And when he slept, his Rest was deep:          But Venus laugh’d, to see and hear him sleep:                   She taught the am’rous Jove                   A magical Receipt in Love, Which arm’d him stronger, and which help’d him more, Than all his Thunder did, and his Almightyship before. II She taught him Love’s Elixir, by which Art His Godhead into Gold he did convert;          No Guards did then his Passage stay,            He pass’d with Ease, Gold was the Word; Subtle as Light’ning, bright, and quick, and fierce, Gold thro’ Doors and Walls did pierce; And as that works sometimes upon the Sword,          Melted the Maidenhead away,          Ev’n in the secret Scabbard where it lay.          The prudent Macedonian King,          To blow up Towns a Golden Mine did spring;          He broke thro’ Gates with this Petarr,          ’Tis the great Art of Peace, the Engine ’tis of War; And Fleets and Armies follow it afar; The Ensign ’tis at Land: and ’tis the Seaman’s Star. \n	'15':5 'afar':218 'almightyship':109 'alon':50 'arm':92 'armi':215 'art':57,120,204 'away':171 'bar':21 'beguil':60 'blow':186 'bolt':18 'book':3 'brass':10 'bright':148 'broke':195 'care':42 'convert':127 'd':25,47,61,73,93,99,137 'deep':69 'door':155 'eas':139 'elixir':117 'engin':208 'ensign':220 'ev':172 'father':33 'fierc':152 'fleet':213 'follow':216 'gate':197 'godhead':122 'gold':124,140,153 'golden':190 'great':203 'guard':129 'head':30 'hear':77 'help':98 'ii':111 'innoc':27 'iron':20 'jealous':32,41 'jove':85 'king':184 'land':223 'laugh':72 'lay':180 'light':146 'lock':16 'love':90,115 'macedonian':183 'magic':87 'maiden':29 'maiden-head':28 'maidenhead':170 'melt':168 'might':22,37 'mine':191 'n':173 'ning':147 'ode':2 'one':11,26 'pass':136 'passag':133 'peac':206 'petarr':200 'pierc':159 'preserv':24 'prudent':182 'quick':150 'receipt':88 'rest':67 'rous':84 'said':14 'scabbard':177 'seaman':227 'secret':176 'see':75 'sleep':79 'slept':65 'smile':52 'sometim':164 'spare':38 'spring':193 'star':229 'stay':134 'stronger':95 'subtl':144 'sword':167 'taught':81,113 'think':54 'thought':34 'three':4 'thro':154,196 'thunder':105 'tis':201,209,221,225 'tower':8 'town':188 'upon':165 'venus':56,71 'walk':46 'wall':157 'war':211 'well':36 'word':143 'work':163 'would':12

476	In the Orchard	207		\nLeave go my hands, let me catch breath and see; Let the dew-fall drench either side of me;     Clear apple-leaves are soft upon that moon Seen sidelong like a blossom in the tree;     And God, ah God, that day should be so soon. The grass is thick and cool, it lets us lie. Kissed upon either cheek and either eye,     I turn to thee as some green afternoon Turns toward sunset, and is loth to die;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Lie closer, lean your face upon my side, Feel where the dew fell that has hardly dried,     Hear how the blood beats that went nigh to swoon; The pleasure lives there when the sense has died,     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. O my fair lord, I charge you leave me this: It is not sweeter than a foolish kiss?     Nay take it then, my flower, my first in June, My rose, so like a tender mouth it is:     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Love, till dawn sunder night from day with fire Dividing my delight and my desire,     The crescent life and love the plenilune, Love me though dusk begin and dark retire;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Ah, my heart fails, my blood draws back; I know, When life runs over, life is near to go;     And with the slain of love love’s ways are strewn, And with their blood, if love will have it so;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Ah, do thy will now; slay me if thou wilt; There is no building now the walls are built,     No quarrying now the corner-stone is hewn, No drinking now the vine’s whole blood is spilt;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Nay, slay me now; nay, for I will be slain; Pluck thy red pleasure from the teeth of pain,     Break down thy vine ere yet grape-gatherers prune, Slay me ere day can slay desire again;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Yea, with thy sweet lips, with thy sweet sword; yea Take life and all, for I will die, I say;     Love, I gave love, is life a better boon? For sweet night’s sake I will not live till day;     Ah God, ah God, that day should be so soon. Nay, I will sleep then only; nay, but go.

522	Alexandreis	243		\nI sing the man that never equal knew, Whose mighty arms all Asia did subdue, Whose conquests through the spacious world do ring, That city-raser, king-destroying king, Who o’er the warlike Macedons did reign, And worthily the name of Great did gain. This is the prince (if fame you will believe, To ancient story any credit give.) Who when the globe of Earth he had subdued, With tears the easy victory pursued; Because that no more worlds there were to win, No further scene to act his glories in.     Ah that some pitying Muse would now inspire My frozen style with a poetic fire, And raptures worthy of his matchless fame, Whose deeds I sing, whose never fading name Long as the world shall fresh and deathless last, No less to future ages, then the past. Great my presumption is, I must confess, But if I thrive, my glory’s ne’er the less; Nor will it from his conquests derogate A female pen his acts did celebrate. If thou O Muse wilt thy assistance give, Such as made Naso and great Maro live, With him whom Melas’ fertile banks did bear, Live, though their bodies dust and ashes are; Whose laurels were not fresher, than their fame Is now, and will for ever be the same. If the like favor thou wilt grant to me, O Queen of Verse, I’ll not ungrateful be, My choicest hours to thee I’ll dedicate, ’Tis thou shalt rule, ’tis thou shalt be my fate. But if coy goddess thou shalt this deny, And from my humble suit disdaining fly, I’ll stoop and beg no more, since I know this, Writing of him, I cannot write amiss: His lofty deeds will raise each feeble line, And god-like acts will make my verse divine.     ’Twas at the time the golden sun doth rise, And with his beams enlights the azure skies, When lo a troop in silver arms drew near, The glorious sun did nere so bright appear; Dire scarlet plumes adorned their haughty crests, And crescent shields did shade their shining breasts; Down from their shoulders hung a panther’s hide, A bow and quiver rattled by their side; Their hands a knotty well tried spear did bear, Jocund they seemed, and quite devoid of fear. These warlike virgins were, that do reside   Near Thermodon’s smooth banks and verdant side, The plains of Themiscyre their birth do boast, Thalestris now did head the beauteous host; She emulating that illustrious dame, Who to the aid of Troy and Priam came, And her who the Retulian prince did aid, Though dearly both for their assistance paid. But fear she scorned, nor the like fate did dread, Her host she often to the field had led, As oft in triumph had returned again, Glory she only sought for all her pain.     This martial queen had heard how loudly fame, Echoed our conqueror’s redoubted name, Her soul his conduct and his courage fired, To see the hero she so much admired; And to Hyrcania for this cause she went, Where Alexander (wholly then intent On triumphs and such military sport) At truce with war held both his camp and court. And while before the town she did attend Her messengers return, she saw ascend A cloud of dust, that covered all the sky, And still at every pause there stroke her eye. The interrupted beams of burnished gold, As dust the splendor hid, or did unfold; Loud neighings of the steeds, and trumpets’ sound Filled all the air, and echoed from the ground; The gallant Greeks with a brisk march drew near, And their great chief did at their head appear. And now come up to th’Amazonian band, They made a halt and a respectful stand: And both the troops (with like amazement strook) Did each on other with deep silence look. Th’heroic queen (whose high pretence to war Cancelled the bashful laws and nicer bar Of modesty, which did her sex restrain) First boldly did advance before her train, And thus she spake. All but a god in name, And that a debt time owes unto thy fame.          This was the first essay of this young lady in          poetry, but finding the task she had undertaken          hard, she laid it by till practice and more time          should make her equal to so great a work.

523	The Introduction	241		\nDid I, my lines intend for public view,\rHow many censures, would their faults pursue,\rSome would, because such words they do affect,\rCry they’re insipid, empty, and uncorrect.\rAnd many have attained, dull and untaught,\rThe name of wit only by finding fault.\rTrue judges might condemn their want of wit,\rAnd all might say, they’re by a woman writ.\rAlas! a woman that attempts the pen,\rSuch an intruder on the rights of men,\rSuch a presumptuous creature, is esteemed,\rThe fault can by no virtue be redeemed.\rThey tell us we mistake our sex and way;\rGood breeding, fashion, dancing, dressing, play\rAre the accomplishments we should desire;\rTo write, or read, or think, or to inquire\rWould cloud our beauty, and exhaust our time,\rAnd interrupt the conquests of our prime;\rWhilst the dull manage of a servile house\rIs held by some our outmost art, and use.\r   Sure ’twas not ever thus, nor are we told\rFables, of women that excelled of old;\rTo whom, by the diffusive hand of Heaven \rSome share of wit, and poetry was given.\rOn that glad day, on which the Ark returned,\rThe holy pledge, for which the land had mourned,\rThe joyful tribes, attend it on the way,\rThe Levites do the sacred charge convey,\rWhilst various instruments, before it play;\rHere, holy virgins in the concert join\rThe louder notes, to soften, and refine,\rAnd with alternate verse complete the hymn divine.\rLo! the young Poet, after God’s own heart,\rBy Him inspired, and taught the Muses’ art,\rReturned from conquest, a bright chorus meets,\rThat sing his slain ten thousand in the streets.\rIn such loud numbers they his acts declare,\rProclaim the wonders of his early war,\rThat Saul upon the vast applause does frown,\rAnd feels its mighty thunder shake the crown.\rWhat, can the threatened judgment now prolong?\rHalf of the kingdom is already gone;\rThe fairest half, whose influence guides the rest,\rHave David’s empire o’er their hearts confessed.\r   A woman here, leads fainting Israel on,\rShe fights, she wins, she triumphs with a song,\rDevout, majestic, for the subject fit,\rAnd far above her arms, exalts her wit;\rThen, to the peaceful, shady palm withdraws,\rAnd rules the rescued nation, with her laws.\rHow are we fall’n, fall’n by mistaken rules?\rAnd education’s, more than nature’s fools,\rDebarred from all improvements of the mind,\rAnd to be dull, expected and designed;\rAnd if some one would soar above the rest,\rWith warmer fancy, and ambition pressed,\rSo strong th’ opposing faction still appears,\rThe hopes to thrive can ne’er outweigh the fears,\rBe cautioned then my Muse, and still retired;\rNor be despised, aiming to be admired;\rConscious of wants, still with contracted wing,\rTo some few friends, and to thy sorrows sing;\rFor groves of laurel thou wert never meant;\rBe dark enough thy shades, and be thou there content.\n	'accomplish':112 'act':289 'admir':468 'affect':25 'aim':465 'ala':66 'alreadi':326 'altern':244 'ambit':435 'appear':443 'applaus':303 'ark':196 'arm':371 'art':154,266 'attain':36 'attempt':70 'attend':210 'beauti':128 'breed':105 'bright':271 'caution':455 'censur':13 'charg':220 'chorus':272 'cloud':126 'complet':246 'concert':233 'condemn':51 'confess':344 'conquest':136,269 'conscious':469 'content':502 'contract':474 'convey':221 'creatur':84 'cri':26 'crown':313 'danc':107 'dark':494 'david':337 'day':192 'debar':408 'declar':290 'design':421 'desir':115 'despis':464 'devout':361 'diffus':177 'divin':249 'dress':108 'dull':37,142,418 'earli':296 'educ':401 'empir':339 'empti':30 'enough':495 'er':341,450 'esteem':86 'ever':160 'exalt':372 'excel':170 'exhaust':130 'expect':419 'fabl':166 'faction':441 'faint':349 'fairest':329 'fall':393,395 'fanci':433 'far':368 'fashion':106 'fault':16,47,88 'fear':453 'feel':307 'fight':353 'find':46 'fit':366 'fool':407 'friend':479 'frown':305 'given':188 'glad':191 'god':255 'gone':327 'good':104 'grove':486 'guid':333 'half':321,330 'hand':178 'heart':258,343 'heaven':180 'held':149 'holi':199,229 'hope':445 'hous':147 'hymn':248 'improv':411 'influenc':332 'inquir':124 'insipid':29 'inspir':261 'instrument':224 'intend':7 'interrupt':134 'introduct':2 'intrud':75 'israel':350 'join':234 'joy':208 'judg':49 'judgment':318 'kingdom':324 'land':204 'laurel':488 'law':389 'lead':348 'levit':216 'line':6 'lo':250 'loud':285 'louder':236 'majest':362 'manag':143 'mani':12,34 'meant':492 'meet':273 'men':80 'might':50,58 'mighti':309 'mind':414 'mistak':99 'mistaken':398 'mourn':206 'muse':265,458 'n':394,396 'name':41 'nation':386 'natur':405 'ne':449 'never':491 'note':237 'number':286 'o':340 'old':172 'one':425 'oppos':440 'outmost':153 'outweigh':451 'palm':380 'peac':378 'pen':72 'play':109,227 'pledg':200 'poet':253 'poetri':186 'press':436 'presumptu':83 'prime':139 'proclaim':291 'prolong':320 'public':9 'pursu':17 're':28,61 'read':119 'redeem':94 'refin':241 'rescu':385 'rest':335,430 'retir':461 'return':197,267 'right':78 'rule':383,399 'sacr':219 'saul':299 'say':59 'servil':146 'sex':101 'shade':497 'shadi':379 'shake':311 'share':182 'sing':275,484 'slain':277 'soar':427 'soften':239 'song':360 'sorrow':483 'still':442,460,472 'street':282 'strong':438 'subject':365 'sure':157 'taught':263 'tell':96 'ten':278 'th':439 'thi':482,496 'think':121 'thou':489,500 'thousand':279 'threaten':317 'thrive':447 'thunder':310 'thus':161 'time':132 'told':165 'tribe':209 'triumph':357 'true':48 'twas':158 'uncorrect':32 'untaught':39 'upon':300 'us':97 'use':156 'various':223 'vast':302 'vers':245 'view':10 'virgin':230 'virtu':92 'want':53,471 'war':297 'warmer':432 'way':103,214 'wert':490 'whilst':140,222 'whose':331 'win':355 'wing':475 'wit':43,55,184,374 'withdraw':381 'woman':64,68,346 'women':168 'wonder':293 'word':22 'would':14,19,125,426 'writ':65 'write':117 'young':252
524	The Spleen	241		\nWhat art thou, Spleen, which ev’ry thing dost ape?\r  Thou Proteus to abused mankind,\r  Who never yet thy real cause could find,\rOr fix thee to remain in one continued shape.\r  Still varying thy perplexing form,\r  Now a Dead Sea thou’lt represent,\r  A calm of stupid discontent,\rThen, dashing on the rocks wilt rage into a storm.\r  Trembling sometimes thou dost appear,\r  Dissolved into a panic fear;\r  On sleep intruding dost thy shadows spread,\r  Thy gloomy terrors round the silent bed,\rAnd crowd with boding dreams the melancholy head;\r  Or, when the midnight hour is told,\r  And drooping lids thou still dost waking hold,\r  Thy fond delusions cheat the eyes,\r  Before them antic specters dance,\rUnusual fires their pointed heads advance,\r  And airy phantoms rise.\r  Such was the monstrous vision seen,\rWhen Brutus (now beneath his cares opprest,\rAnd all Rome’s fortunes rolling in his breast,\r  Before Philippi’s latest field,\rBefore his fate did to Octavius lead)\r  Was vanquished by the Spleen.\r  Falsely, the mortal part we blame\r  Or our depressed, and pond’rous frame,\r  Which, till the first degrading sin\r  Let thee, its dull attendant, in,\r  Still with the other did comply,\rNor clogged the active soul, disposed to fly,\rAnd range the mansions of its native sky.\r  Nor, whilst in his own heaven he dwelt,\r  Whilst Man his paradise possessed,\rHis fertile Garden in the fragrant East,\r  And all united odors smelled,\r  No armèd sweets, until thy reign,\r  Could shock the sense, or in the face\r  A flushed, unhandsome color place.\rNow the jonquil o’ercomes the feeble brain;\rWe faint beneath the aromatic pain,\rTill some offensive scent thy pow’rs appease,\rAnd pleasure we resign for short and nauseous ease.\r  In ev’ry one thou dost possess,\r  New are thy motions, and thy dress:\r  Now in some grove a list’ning friend\r  Thy false suggestions must attend,\rThy whispered griefs, thy fancied sorrows hear,\rBreathed in a sigh, and witnessed by a tear;\r  Whilst in the light and vulgar crowd,\r  Thy slaves, more clamorous and loud,\rBy laughters unprovoked, thy influence too confess.\rIn the imperious wife thou vapors art,\r  Which from o’erheated passions rise\r  In clouds to the attractive brain,\r  Until descending thence again,\r  Through the o’er-cast and show’ring eyes,\r  Upon her husband’s softened heart,\r  He the disputed point must yield,\rSomething resign of the contested field;\rTill lordly Man, born to imperial sway,\rCompounds for peace, to make that right away,\rAnd Woman, arm’d with Spleen, does servilely obey.\r  The fool, to imitate the wits,\r  Complains of thy pretended fits,\r  And dullness, born with him, would lay\r  Upon thy accidental sway;\r  Because, sometimes, thou dost presume\r  Into the ablest heads to come:\r  That, often, men of thoughts refined,\r  Impatient of unequal sense,\rSuch slow returns, where they so much dispense,\rRetiring from the crowd, are to thy shades inclined.\r  O’er me alas! thou dost too much prevail:\r  I feel thy force, whilst I against thee rail;\rI feel my verse decay, and my cramped numbers fail.\rThrough thy black jaundice I all objects see,\r  As dark and terrible as thee,\rMy lines decried, and my employment thought\rAn useless folly, or presumptuous fault:\r  Whilst in the Muses’ paths I stray,\rWhilst in their groves, and by their secret springs\rMy hand delights to trace unusual things,\rAnd deviates from the known and common way;\r  Nor will in fading silks compose  \r  Faintly th’ inimitable rose,\rFill up an ill-drawn bird, or paint on glass\rThe sov’reign’s blurred and undistinguished face,\rThe threat’ning angel, and the speaking ass.\r  Patron thou art to ev’ry gross abuse,\r       The sullen husband’s feigned excuse, \rWhen the ill humor with his wife he spends,\rAnd bears recruited wit, and spirits to his friends.\r       The son of Bacchus pleads thy pow’r,\r       As to the glass he still repairs,\r       Pretends but to remove thy cares,\rSnatch from thy shades one gay and smiling hour,\rAnd drown thy kingdom in a purple show’r.\rWhen the Coquette, whom ev’ry fool admires,\r       Would in variety be fair,\r       And, changing hastily the scene,\r       From light, impertinent, and vain,\rAssumes a soft, a melancholy air,\rAnd of her eyes rebates the wand’ring fires,\rThe careless posture, and the head reclined,\r       The thoughtful, and composèd face,\r  Proclaiming the withdrawn, the absent mind,\r  Allows the Fop more liberty to gaze,\r  Who gently for the tender cause inquires;\r  The cause, indeed, is a defect in sense,\rYet is the Spleen alleged, and still the dull pretence.\r       But these are thy fantastic harms, \r       The tricks of thy pernicious stage,\r       Which do the weaker sort engage;\r  Worse are the dire effects of thy more pow’rful charms.\r       By thee Religion, all we know,\r       That should enlighten here below,\r       Is veiled in darkness, and perplexed\r  With anxious doubts, with endless scruples vexed,\rAnd some restraint implied from each perverted text.\r  Whilst touch not, taste not, what is freely giv’n,\rIs but thy niggard voice, disgracing bounteous heav’n.\r  From speech restrained, by thy deceits abused,\r  To deserts banished, or in cells reclused,\r  Mistaken vot’ries to the pow’rs divine,\r  Whilst they a purer sacrifice design,\rDo but the Spleen obey, and worship at thy shrine.\r  In vain to chase thee ev’ry art we try,\r       In vain all remedies apply,\r       In vain the Indian leaf infuse,\r       Or the parched Eastern berry bruise;\rSome pass, in vain, those bounds, and nobler liquors use.\r       Now harmony, in vain, we bring,\r       Inspire the flute, and touch the string.\r       From harmony no help is had;\rMusic but soothes thee, if too sweetly sad,\rAnd if too light, but turns thee gaily mad.\r       Though the physicians greatest gains,\r       Although his growing wealth he sees\r       Daily increased by ladies’ fees,\r  Yet dost thou baffle all his studious pains.\r       Not skillful Lower thy source could find,\r  Or through the well-dissected body trace\r       The secret, the mysterious ways,\rBy which thou dost surprise, and prey upon the mind.\rThough in the search, too deep for humane thought,\r  With unsuccessful toil he wrought,\r’Till thinking thee to’ve catched, himself by thee was caught,\r  Retained thy pris’ner, thy acknowledged slave,\rAnd sunk beneath thy chain to a lamented grave.\n	'ablest':458 'absent':737

531	A Nocturnal Reverie	241		\nIn such a night, when every louder wind\rIs to its distant cavern safe confined;\rAnd only gentle Zephyr fans his wings,\rAnd lonely Philomel, still waking, sings;\rOr from some tree, famed for the owl’s delight,\rShe, hollowing clear, directs the wand’rer right:\rIn such a night, when passing clouds give place,\rOr thinly veil the heav’ns’ mysterious face;\rWhen in some river, overhung with green,\rThe waving moon and the trembling leaves are seen;\rWhen freshened grass now bears itself upright,\rAnd makes cool banks to pleasing rest invite,\rWhence springs the woodbind, and the bramble-rose,\rAnd where the sleepy cowslip sheltered grows;\rWhilst now a paler hue the foxglove takes,\rYet checkers still with red the dusky brakes\rWhen scatter’d glow-worms, but in twilight fine,\rShew trivial beauties, watch their hour to shine;\rWhilst Salisb’ry stands the test of every light,\rIn perfect charms, and perfect virtue bright:\rWhen odors, which declined repelling day,\rThrough temp’rate air uninterrupted stray;\rWhen darkened groves their softest shadows wear,\rAnd falling waters we distinctly hear;\rWhen through the gloom more venerable shows\rSome ancient fabric, awful in repose,\rWhile sunburnt hills their swarthy looks conceal,\rAnd swelling haycocks thicken up the vale:\rWhen the loosed horse now, as his pasture leads,\rComes slowly grazing through th’ adjoining meads,\rWhose stealing pace, and lengthened shade we fear,\rTill torn-up forage in his teeth we hear:\rWhen nibbling sheep at large pursue their food,\rAnd unmolested kine rechew the cud;\rWhen curlews cry beneath the village walls,\rAnd to her straggling brood the partridge calls;\rTheir shortlived jubilee the creatures keep,\rWhich but endures, whilst tyrant man does sleep;\rWhen a sedate content the spirit feels,\rAnd no fierce light disturbs, whilst it reveals;\rBut silent musings urge the mind to seek\rSomething, too high for syllables to speak;\rTill the free soul to a composedness charmed,\rFinding the elements of rage disarmed,\rO’er all below a solemn quiet grown,\rJoys in th’ inferior world, and thinks it like her own:\rIn such a night let me abroad remain,\rTill morning breaks, and all’s confused again;\rOur cares, our toils, our clamors are renewed,\rOr pleasures, seldom reached, again pursued.\n	'abroad':362 'adjoin':230 'air':173

536	A Description of a City Shower	246		\nCareful observers may foretell the hour (By sure prognostics) when to dread a shower: While rain depends, the pensive cat gives o’er Her frolics, and pursues her tail no more. Returning home at night, you’ll find the sink Strike your offended sense with double stink. If you be wise, then go not far to dine; You’ll spend in coach hire more than save in wine. A coming shower your shooting corns presage, Old achès throb, your hollow tooth will rage. Sauntering in coffeehouse is Dulman seen; He damns the climate and complains of spleen.          Meanwhile the South, rising with dabbled wings, A sable cloud athwart the welkin flings, That swilled more liquor than it could contain, And, like a drunkard, gives it up again. Brisk Susan whips her linen from the rope, While the first drizzling shower is born aslope: Such is that sprinkling which some careless quean Flirts on you from her mop, but not so clean: You fly, invoke the gods; then turning, stop To rail; she singing, still whirls on her mop. Not yet the dust had shunned the unequal strife, But, aided by the wind, fought still for life, And wafted with its foe by violent gust, ’Twas doubtful which was rain and which was dust. Ah! where must needy poet seek for aid, When dust and rain at once his coat invade? Sole coat, where dust cemented by the rain Erects the nap, and leaves a mingled stain.          Now in contiguous drops the flood comes down, Threatening with deluge this devoted town. To shops in crowds the daggled females fly, Pretend to cheapen goods, but nothing buy. The Templar spruce, while every spout’s abroach, Stays till ’tis fair, yet seems to call a coach. The tucked-up sempstress walks with hasty strides, While seams run down her oiled umbrella’s sides. Here various kinds, by various fortunes led, Commence acquaintance underneath a shed. Triumphant Tories and desponding Whigs Forget their feuds, and join to save their wigs. Boxed in a chair the beau impatient sits, While spouts run clattering o’er the roof by fits, And ever and anon with frightful din The leather sounds; he trembles from within. So when Troy chairmen bore the wooden steed, Pregnant with Greeks impatient to be freed (Those bully Greeks, who, as the moderns do, Instead of paying chairmen, run them through), Laocoön struck the outside with his spear, And each imprisoned hero quaked for fear.          Now from all parts the swelling kennels flow, And bear their trophies with them as they go: Filth of all hues and odors seem to tell What street they sailed from, by their sight and smell. They, as each torrent drives with rapid force, From Smithfield or St. Pulchre’s shape their course, And in huge confluence joined at Snow Hill ridge, Fall from the conduit prone to Holborn Bridge. Sweepings from butchers’ stalls, dung, guts, and blood, Drowned puppies, stinking sprats, all drenched in mud, Dead cats, and turnip tops, come tumbling down the flood.\n	'abroach':289 'achè':83 'acquaint':326 'ah':220 'aid':195,227 'anon':365 'aslop':149 'athwart':114 'bear':429 'beau':349 'blood':497 'bore':380 'born':148 'box':344 'bridg':489 'brisk':134 'bulli':392 'butcher':492 'buy':281 'call':297 'care':7 'careless':156 'cat':26,507 'cement':241 'chair':347 'chairmen':379,402 'cheapen':277 'citi':5 'clatter':355 'clean':167 'climat':99 'cloud':113 'coach':68,299 'coat':235,238 'coffeehous':92 'come':76,259,511 'commenc':325 'complain':101 'conduit':485 'confluenc':476 'contain':125 'contigu':255 'corn':80 'could':124 'cours':472 'crowd':270 'dabbl':109 'daggl':272 'damn':97 'dead':506 'delug':263 'depend':23 'descript':2 'despond':333 'devot':265 'din':368 'dine':63 'doubl':52 'doubt':212 'dread':18 'drench':503 'drive':460 'drizzl':145 'drop':256 'drown':498 'drunkard':129 'dulman':94 'dung':494 'dust':188,219,229,240 'er':29,357 'erect':245 'ever':363 'everi':286 'fair':293 'fall':482 'far':61 'fear':419 'femal':273 'feud':337 'filth':437 'find':44 'first':144 'fit':361 'fli':169,274 'fling':117 'flirt':158 'flood':258,515 'flow':427 'foe':207 'forc':463 'foretel':10 'forget':335 'fortun':323 'fought':199 'freed':390 'fright':367 'frolic':31 'give':27,130 'go':59,436 'god':172 'good':278 'greek':386,393 'gust':210 'gut':495 'hasti':307 'hero':416 'hill':480 'hire':69 'holborn':488 'hollow':86 'home':39 'hour':12 'hue':440 'huge':475 'impati':350,387 'imprison':415 'instead':399 'invad':236 'invok':170 'join':339,477 'kennel':426 'kind':320 'laocoön':406 'leather':370 'leav':249 'led':324 'life':202 'like':127 'linen':138 'liquor':121 'll':43,65 'may':9 'meanwhil':104 'mingl':251 'modern':397 'mop':163,184 'mud':505 'must':222 'nap':247 'needi':223 'night':41 'noth':280 'o':28,356 'observ':8 'odor':442 'offend':49 'oil':314 'old':82 'outsid':409 'part':423 'pay':401 'pensiv':25 'poet':224 'pregnant':384 'presag':81 'pretend':275 'prognost':15 'prone':486 'pulchr':468 'puppi':499 'pursu':33 'quak':417 'quean':157 'rage':89 'rail':177 'rain':22,215,231,244 'rapid':462 'return':38 'ridg':481 'rise':107 'roof':359 'rope':141 'run':311,354,403 'sabl':112 'sail':449 'saunter':90 'save':72,341 'seam':310 'seek':225 'seem':295,443 'seen':95 'sempstress':304 'sens':50 'shape':470 'shed':329 'shoot':79 'shop':268 'shower':6,20,77,146 'shun':190 'side':317 'sight':453 'sing':179 'sink':46 'sit':351 'smell':455 'smithfield':465 'snow':479 'sole':237 'sound':371 'south':106 'spear':412 'spend':66 'spleen':103 'spout':287,353 'sprat':501 'sprinkl':153 'spruce':284 'st':467 'stain':252 'stall':493 'stay':290 'steed':383 'still':180,200 'stink':53,500 'stop':175 'street':447 'stride':308 'strife':193 'strike':47 'struck':407 'sure':14 'susan':135 'sweep':490 'swell':425 'swill':119 'tail':35 'tell':445 'templar':283 'threaten':261 'throb':84 'till':291 'tis':292 'tooth':87 'top':510 'tori':331 'torrent':459 'town':266 'trembl':373 'triumphant':330 'trophi':431 'troy':378 'tuck':302 'tucked-up':301 'tumbl':512 'turn':174 'turnip':509 'twas':211 'umbrella':315 'underneath':327 'unequ':192 'various':319,322 'violent':209 'waft':204 'walk':305 'welkin':116 'whig':334 'whip':136 'whirl':181 'wig':343 'wind':198 'wine':74 'wing':110 'wise':57 'within':375 'wooden':382 'yet':186,294
537	The Lady’s Dressing Room	246		\nFive hours, (and who can do it less in?) By haughty Celia spent in dressing; The goddess from her chamber issues, Arrayed in lace, brocades and tissues.          Strephon, who found the room was void, And Betty otherwise employed, Stole in, and took a strict survey, Of all the litter as it lay; Whereof, to make the matter clear, An inventory follows here.          And first a dirty smock appeared, Beneath the armpits well besmeared. Strephon, the rogue, displayed it wide, And turned it round on every side. On such a point few words are best, And Strephon bids us guess the rest, But swears how damnably the men lie, In calling Celia sweet and cleanly. Now listen while he next produces The various combs for various uses, Filled up with dirt so closely fixt, No brush could force a way betwixt. A paste of composition rare, Sweat, dandruff, powder, lead and hair; A forehead cloth with oil upon’t To smooth the wrinkles on her front; Here alum flower to stop the steams, Exhaled from sour unsavory streams, There night-gloves made of Tripsy’s hide, Bequeathed by Tripsy when she died, With puppy water, beauty’s help Distilled from Tripsy’s darling whelp; Here gallypots and vials placed, Some filled with washes, some with paste, Some with pomatum, paints and slops, And ointments good for scabby chops. Hard by a filthy basin stands, Fouled with the scouring of her hands; The basin takes whatever comes The scrapings of her teeth and gums, A nasty compound of all hues, For here she spits, and here she spews. But oh! it turned poor Strephon’s bowels, When he beheld and smelled the towels, Begummed, bemattered, and beslimed With dirt, and sweat, and earwax grimed. No object Strephon’s eye escapes, Here petticoats in frowzy heaps; Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot All varnished o’er with snuff and snot. The stockings why should I expose, Stained with the marks of stinking toes; Or greasy coifs and pinners reeking, Which Celia slept at least a week in? A pair of tweezers next he found To pluck her brows in arches round, Or hairs that sink the forehead low, Or on her chin like bristles grow.          The virtues we must not let pass, Of Celia’s magnifying glass. When frightened Strephon cast his eye on’t It showed visage of a giant. A glass that can to sight disclose, The smallest worm in Celia’s nose, And faithfully direct her nail To squeeze it out from head to tail; For catch it nicely by the head, It must come out alive or dead.          Why Strephon will you tell the rest? And must you needs describe the chest? That careless wench! no creature warn her To move it out from yonder corner; But leave it standing full in sight For you to exercise your spite. In vain the workman showed his wit With rings and hinges counterfeit To make it seem in this disguise A cabinet to vulgar eyes; For Strephon ventured to look in, Resolved to go through thick and thin; He lifts the lid, there needs no more, He smelled it all the time before. As from within Pandora’s box, When Epimetheus op’d the locks, A sudden universal crew Of human evils upwards flew; He still was comforted to find That Hope at last remained behind; So Strephon lifting up the lid, To view what in the chest was hid. The vapors flew from out the vent, But Strephon cautious never meant The bottom of the pan to grope, And foul his hands in search of Hope. O never may such vile machine Be once in Celia’s chamber seen! O may she better learn to keep Those “secrets of the hoary deep!”          As mutton cutlets, prime of meat, Which though with art you salt and beat As laws of cookery require, And toast them at the clearest fire; If from adown the hopeful chops The fat upon a cinder drops, To stinking smoke it turns the flame Pois’ning the flesh from whence it came, And up exhales a greasy stench, For which you curse the careless wench; So things, which must not be expressed, When plumped into the reeking chest, Send up an excremental smell To taint the parts from whence they fell. The petticoats and gown perfume, Which waft a stink round every room. Thus finishing his grand survey, Disgusted Strephon stole away Repeating in his amorous fits, Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia shits!          But Vengeance, goddess never sleeping Soon punished Strephon for his peeping; His foul imagination links Each Dame he sees with all her stinks: And, if unsavory odors fly, Conceives a lady standing by: All women his description fits, And both ideas jump like wits: But vicious fancy coupled fast, And still appearing in contrast. I pity wretched Strephon blind To all the charms of female kind; Should I the queen of love refuse, Because she rose from stinking ooze? To him that looks behind the scene, Satira’s but some pocky queen. When Celia in her glory shows, If Strephon would but stop his nose (Who now so impiously blasphemes Her ointments, daubs, and paints and creams, Her washes, slops, and every clout, With which he makes so foul a rout) He soon would learn to think like me, And bless his ravished sight to see Such order from confusion sprung, Such gaudy tulips raised from dung.\n	'adown':666 'aliv':442 'alum':172

538	A Beautiful Young Nymph Going to Bed	246		\nCorinna, pride of Drury-Lane For whom no shepherd sighs in vain; Never did Covent Garden boast So bright a battered, strolling toast; No drunken rake to pick her up, No cellar where on tick to sup; Returning at the midnight hour; Four stories climbing to her bow’r; Then, seated on a three-legged chair, Takes off her artificial hair: Now, picking out a crystal eye, She wipes it clean, and lays it by. Her eye-brows from a mouse’s hide, Stuck on with art on either side, Pulls off with care, and first displays ’em, Then in a play-book smoothly lays ’em. Now dexterously her plumpers draws, That serve to fill her hollow jaws. Untwists a wire; and from her gums A set of teeth completely comes. Pulls out the rags contrived to prop Her flabby dugs and down they drop. Proceeding on, the lovely goddess Unlaces next her steel-ribbed bodice; Which by the operator’s skill, Press down the lumps, the hollows fill, Up goes her hand, and off she slips The bolsters that supply her hips. With gentlest touch, she next explores Her shankers, issues, running sores, Effects of many a sad disaster; And then to each applies a plaister. But must, before she goes to bed, Rub off the dawbs of white and red; And smooth the furrows in her front With greasy paper stuck upon’t. She takes a bolus ere she sleeps; And then between two blankets creeps. With pains of love tormented lies; Or if she chance to close her eyes, Of Bridewell and the Compter dreams, And feels the lash, and faintly screams; Or, by a faithless bully drawn, At some hedge-tavern lies in pawn; Or to Jamaica seems transported, Alone, and by no planter courted; Or, near Fleet-Ditch’s oozy brinks, Surrounded with a hundred stinks, Belated, seems on watch to lie, And snap some cully passing by; Or, struck with fear, her fancy runs On watchmen, constables and duns, From whom she meets with frequent rubs; But, never from religious clubs; Whose favor she is sure to find, Because she pays ’em all in kind.          Corinna wakes. A dreadful sight! Behold the ruins of the night! A wicked rat her plaster stole, Half eat, and dragged it to his hole. The crystal eye, alas, was missed; And puss had on her plumpers pissed. A pigeon picked her issue-peas; And Shock her tresses filled with fleas.          The nymph, tho’ in this mangled plight, Must ev’ry morn her limbs unite. But how shall I describe her arts To recollect the scattered parts? Or shew the anguish, toil, and pain, Of gath’ring up herself again? The bashful muse will never bear In such a scene to interfere.

539	The Day of Judgment	247		\nWhen the fierce north wind with his airy forces Rears up the Baltic to a foaming fury, And the red lightning with a storm of hail comes                                Rushing amain down, How the poor sailors stand amazed and tremble, While the hoarse thunder, like a bloody trumpet, Roars a loud onset to the gaping waters,                                Quick to devour them! Such shall the noise be and the wild disorder, (If things eternal may be like these earthly) Such the dire terror, when the great Archangel                                Shakes the creation, Tears the strong pillars of the vault of heaven, Breaks up old marble, the repose of princes; See the graves open, and the bones arising,                                Flames all around ’em! Hark, the shrill outcries of the guilty wretches! Lively bright horror and amazing anguish Stare through their eyelids, while the living worm lies                                Gnawing within them. Thoughts like old vultures prey upon their heart-strings, And the smart twinges, when the eye beholds the Lofty Judge frowning, and a flood of vengeance                                Rolling afore him. Hopeless immortals! how they scream and shiver, While devils push them to the pit wide-yawning Hideous and gloomy, to receive them headlong                            Down to the center. Stop here, my fancy: (all away ye horrid Doleful ideas); come, arise to Jesus; How He sits God-like! and the saints around him                                Throned, yet adoring! Oh may I sit there when he comes triumphant Dooming the nations! then ascend to glory While our hosannas all along the passage                                Shout the Redeemer.\n	'ador':231 'afor':174 'airi':12 'along':252 'amain':33 'amaz':40,132 'anguish':133 'archangel':87 'aris':115,215 'around':118,227 'ascend':245 'away':209 'baltic':17 'behold':163 'bloodi':49 'bone':114 'break':100 'bright':129 'center':203 'come':31,214,239 'creation':90 'day':2 'devil':184 'devour':61 'dire':82 'disord':71 'dole':212 'doom':241 'earth':79 'em':119 'etern':74 'eye':162 'eyelid':137 'fanci':207 'fierc':7 'flame':116 'flood':170 'foam':20 'forc':13 'frown':167 'furi':21 'gape':57 'gloomi':195 'glori':247 'gnaw':143 'god':222 'god-lik':221 'grave':110 'great':86 'guilti':126 'hail':30 'hark':120 'headlong':199 'heart':154 'heart-str':153 'heaven':99 'hideous':193 'hoars':45 'hopeless':176 'horrid':211 'horror':130 'hosanna':250 'idea':213 'immort':177 'jesus':217 'judg':166 'judgment':4 'lie':142 'lightn':25 'like':47,77,147,223 'live':128,140 'lofti':165 'loud':53 'marbl':103 'may':75,233 'nation':243 'nois':66 'north':8 'oh':232 'old':102,148 'onset':54 'open':111 'outcri':123 'passag':254 'pillar':94 'pit':189 'poor':37 'prey':150 'princ':107 'push':185 'quick':59 'rear':14 'receiv':197 'red':24 'redeem':257 'repos':105 'roar':51 'roll':173 'rush':32 'sailor':38 'saint':226 'scream':180 'see':108 'shake':88 'shall':64 'shiver':182 'shout':255 'shrill':122 'sit':220,235 'smart':158 'stand':39 'stare':134 'stop':204 'storm':28 'string':155 'strong':93 'tear':91 'terror':83 'thing':73 'thought':146 'throne':229 'thunder':46 'trembl':42 'triumphant':240 'trumpet':50 'twing':159 'upon':151 'vault':97 'vengeanc':172 'vultur':149 'water':58 'wide':191 'wide-yawn':190 'wild':70 'wind':9 'within':144 'worm':141 'wretch':127 'yawn':192 'ye':210 'yet':230

Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood    Stand dressed in living green: So to the Jews old Canaan stood,    While Jordan rolled between. But timorous mortals start and shrink    To cross this narrow sea, And linger shivering on the brink,    And fear to launch away. Oh could we make our doubts remove,    These gloomy doubts that rise, And see the Canaan that we love,    With unbeclouded eyes; Could we but climb where Moses stood    And view the landscape o’er, Not Jordan’s stream, nor death’s cold flood,    Should fright us from the shore.\n	'abid':31 'away':91 'banish':26 'beyond':50 'brink':86 'canaan':64,107 'climb':117 'cold':134 'could':93,114 'cross':77 'day':20 'death':6,37,132 'delight':14 'divid':42 'doubt':97,101 'dress':55 'easi':7 'er':126 'everlast':29 'exclud':21 'eye':113 'fear':88 'field':49 'flood':53,135 'flower':36 'fright':137 'gloomi':100 'green':58 'heaven':4,44 'immort':17 'infinit':19 'jew':62 'jordan':67,128 'land':11,45 'landscap':124 'launch':90 'like':38 'linger':82 'live':57 'love':110 'make':5,95 'mortal':72 'mose':119 'narrow':40,79 'never':34 'never-with':33 'night':23 'o':125 'oh':92 'old':63 'pain':27 'pleasur':25 'prospect':2 'pure':13 'reign':18 'remov':98 'rise':103 'roll':68 'saint':16 'sea':41,80 'see':105 'shiver':83 'shore':141 'shrink':75 'spring':30 'stand':54 'start':73 'stood':65,120 'stream':130 'sweet':48 'swell':52 'timor':71 'unbecloud':112 'us':138 'view':122 'wither':35

Before the hills in order stood    Or earth received her frame, From everlasting thou art God,    To endless years the same. Thy word commands our flesh to dust,    “Return, ye sons of men”; All nations rose from earth at first,    And turn to earth again. A thousand ages in thy sight    Are like an evening gone; Short as the watch that ends the night    Before the rising sun. The busy tribes of flesh and blood,    With all their lives and cares, Are carried downwards by thy flood,    And lost in following years. Time, like an ever-rolling stream,    Bears all its sons away; They fly forgotten, as a dream    Dies at the opening day. Like flowery fields the nations stand,    Pleased with the morning light; The flowers beneath the mower’s hand    Lie withering e’er ’tis night. Our God, our help in ages past,    Our hope for years to come, Be thou our guard while troubles last,    And our eternal home.\n	'age':10,96,193 'alon':43 'arm':42 'art':63 'away':152 'bear':148 'beneath':177 'blast':23 'blood':123 'busi':118 'care':129 'carri':131 'come':17,200 'command':72 'day':163 'defens':46 'die':159 'downward':132 'dream':158 'dust':76 'dwelt':37 'e':184 'earth':56,86,92 'end':110 'endless':66 'er':185 'etern':26,210 'even':103 'ever':145 'ever-rol':144 'everlast':61 'field':166 'first':88 'flesh':74,121 'fli':154 'flood':135 'flower':176 'floweri':165 'follow':139 'forgotten':155 'frame':59 'god':2,6,64,189 'gone':104 'guard':204 'hand':181 'help':4,8,191 'hill':51 'home':27,211 'hope':13,196 'last':207 'lie':182 'light':174 'like':101,142,164 'live':127 'lost':137 'men':81 'morn':173 'mower':179 'nation':83,168 'night':112,187 'open':162 'order':53 'past':11,194 'pleas':170 'receiv':57 'return':77 'rise':115 'roll':146 'rose':84 'saint':35 'secur':38 'shadow':30 'shelter':19 'short':105 'sight':99 'son':79,151 'stand':169 'stood':54 'stormi':22 'stream':147 'suffici':39 'sun':116 'sure':48 'thi':32,34,70,98,134 'thine':41 'thou':62,202 'thousand':95 'throne':33 'time':141 'tis':186 'tribe':119 'troubl':206 'turn':90 'watch':108 'wither':183 'word':71 'ye':78 'year':15,67,140,198
542	Psalm 58	247		\nJudges, who rule the world by laws, Will ye despise the righteous cause,    When th’injur’d poor before you stands? Dare ye condemn the righteous poor, And let rich sinners ’scape secure,    While gold and greatness bribe your hands? Have ye forgot or never knew That God will judge the judges too?    High in the Heavens his justice reigns; Yet you invade the rights of God, And send your bold decrees abroad    To bind the conscience in your chains. A poisoned arrow is your tongue, The arrow sharp, the poison strong,    And death attends where e’er it wounds: You hear no counsels, cries or tears; So the deaf adder stops her ears    Against the power of charming sounds. Break out their teeth, eternal God, Those teeth of lions dyed in blood;    And crush the serpents in the dust: As empty chaff, when whirlwinds rise, Before the sweeping tempest flies,    So let their hopes and names be lost. Th’Almighty thunders from the sky, Their grandeur melts, their titles die,    As hills of snow dissolve and run, Or snails that perish in their slime, Or births that come before their time,    Vain births, that never see the sun. Thus shall the vengeance of the Lord Safety and joy to saints afford;    And all that hear shall join and say, “Sure there’s a God that rules on high, “A God that hears his children cry,    “And will their sufferings well repay.”\n	'58':2 'abroad':75 'adder':113 'afford':214 'almighti':163 'arrow':85,90 'attend':97 'bind':77 'birth':189,196 'blood':135 'bold':73 'break':123 'bribe':40 'caus':15 'chaff':145 'chain':82 'charm':121 'children':237 'come':191 'condemn':26 'conscienc':79 'counsel':106 'cri':107,238 'crush':137 'd':19 'dare':24 'deaf':112 'death':96 'decre':74 'despis':12 'die':173 'dissolv':178 'dust':142 'dy':133 'e':99 'ear':116 'empti':144 'er':100 'etern':127 'fli':153 'forgot':45 'god':50,69,128,227,233 'gold':37 'grandeur':169 'great':39 'hand':42 'hear':104,218,235 'heaven':59 'high':56,231 'hill':175 'hope':157 'injur':18 'invad':65 'join':220 'joy':211 'judg':3,52,54 'justic':61 'knew':48 'law':9 'let':31,155 'lion':132 'lord':208 'lost':161 'melt':170 'name':159 'never':47,198 'perish':184 'poison':84,93 'poor':20,29 'power':119 'psalm':1 'reign':62 'repay':244 'rich':32 'right':67 'righteous':14,28 'rise':148 'rule':5,229 'run':180 'safeti':209 'saint':213 'say':222 'scape':34 'secur':35 'see':199 'send':71 'serpent':139 'shall':203,219 'sharp':91 'sinner':33 'sky':167 'slime':187 'snail':182 'snow':177 'sound':122 'stand':23 'stop':114 'strong':94 'suffer':242 'sun':201 'sure':223 'sweep':151 'tear':109 'teeth':126,130 'tempest':152 'th':17,162 'thunder':164 'thus':202 'time':194 'titl':172 'tongu':88 'vain':195 'vengeanc':205 'well':243 'whirlwind':147 'world':7 'wound':102 'ye':11,25,44 'yet':63

The mountains shook like frighted sheep, Like lambs the little hillocks leap; Not Sinai on her base could stand, Conscious of sov’reign pow’r at hand. What pow’r could make the deep divide? Make Jordan backward roll his tide? Why did ye leap, ye little hills? And whence the fright that Sinai feels? Let ev’ry mountain, ev’ry flood, Retire and know th’ approaching God, The King of Isr’el: see him here! Tremble, thou earth, adore and fear.

575	Past-Lives Therapy	259		\nThey explained to me the bloody bandages On the floor in the maternity ward in Rochester, N.Y.,   Cured the backache I acquired bowing to my old master,   Made me stop putting thumbtacks round my bed. They showed me an officer on horseback, Waving a saber next to a burning farmhouse   And a barefoot woman in a nightgown, Throwing stones after him and calling him Lucifer. I was a straw-headed boy in patched overalls.   Come dark a chicken would roost in my hair.   Some even laid eggs as I played my ukulele   And my mother and father crossed themselves. Next, I saw myself inside an abandoned gas station   Constructing a spaceship out of a coffin, Red traffic cone, cement mixer and ear warmers, When a church lady fainted seeing me in my underwear. Some days, however, they opened door after door,   Always to a different room, and could not find me.   There’d be only a small squeak now and then,   As if a miner’s canary got caught in a mousetrap.\n	'abandon':111 'acquir':26 'alway':147 'backach':24 'bandag':11 'barefoot':57 'bed':39 'bloodi':10 'bow':27 'boy':76 'burn':53 'call':67 'canari':172 'caught':174 'cement':124 'chicken':83 'church':131 'coffin':120 'come':80 'cone':123 'construct':114 'could':153 'cross':103 'cure':22 'd':158 'dark':81 'day':140 'differ':150 'door':144,146 'ear':127 'egg':92 'even':90 'explain':6 'faint':133 'farmhous':54 'father':102 'find':155 'floor':14 'gas':112 'got':173 'hair':88 'head':75 'horseback':46 'howev':141 'insid':109 'ladi':132 'laid':91 'live':3 'lucif':69 'made':32 'master':31 'matern':17 'miner':170 'mixer':125 'mother':100 'mousetrap':177 'n.y':21 'next':50,105 'nightgown':61 'offic':44 'old':30 'open':143 'overal':79 'past':2 'past-liv':1 'patch':78 'play':95 'put':35 'red':121 'rochest':20 'room':151 'roost':85 'round':37 'saber':49 'saw':107 'see':134 'show':41 'small':162 'spaceship':116 'squeak':163 'station':113 'stone':63 'stop':34 'straw':74 'straw-head':73 'therapi':4 'throw':62 'thumbtack':36 'traffic':122 'ukulel':97 'underwear':138 'ward':18 'warmer':128 'wave':47 'woman':58 'would':84
548	The Universal Prayer	209		\nFather of all! in every age,     In every clime adored, By saint, by savage, and by sage,     Jehovah, Jove, or Lord! Thou Great First Cause, least understood:     Who all my sense confined To know but this—that thou art good,     And that myself am blind: Yet gave me, in this dark estate,     To see the good from ill; And binding Nature fast in fate,     Left free the human will. What conscience dictates to be done,     Or warns me not to do, This, teach me more than Hell to shun,     That, more than Heaven pursue. What blessings thy free bounty gives,     Let me not cast away; For God is paid when man receives,     To enjoy is to obey. Yet not to earth’s contracted span,     Thy goodness let me bound, Or think thee Lord alone of man,     When thousand worlds are round: Let not this weak, unknowing hand     Presume thy bolts to throw, And deal damnation round the land,     On each I judge thy foe. If I am right, thy grace impart,     Still in the right to stay; If I am wrong, oh teach my heart     To find a better way. Save me alike from foolish pride,     Or impious discontent, At aught thy wisdom has denied,     Or aught thy goodness lent. Teach me to feel another’s woe,     To hide the fault I see; That mercy I to others show,     That mercy show to me. Mean though I am, not wholly so     Since quickened by thy breath; Oh lead me wheresoe’er I go,     Through this day’s life or death. This day, be bread and peace my lot:     All else beneath the sun, Thou know’st if best bestowed or not,     And let thy will be done. To thee, whose temple is all space,     Whose altar, earth, sea, skies! One chorus let all being raise!     All Nature’s incense rise!\n	'ador':13 'age':9 'alik':196 'alon':137 'altar':299 'anoth':218 'art':42 'aught':204,210 'away':108 'beneath':274 'best':281 'bestow':282 'better':192 'bind':63 'bless':99 'blind':48 'bolt':153 'bound':132 'bounti':102 'bread':267 'breath':249 'cast':107 'caus':28 'chorus':304 'clime':12 'confin':35 'conscienc':74 'contract':126 'damnat':158 'dark':54 'day':259,265 'deal':157 'death':263 'deni':208 'dictat':75 'discont':202 'done':78,290 'earth':124,300 'els':273 'enjoy':117 'er':254 'estat':55 'everi':8,11 'fast':65 'fate':67 'father':4 'fault':224 'feel':217 'find':190 'first':27 'foe':167 'foolish':198 'free':69,101 'gave':50 'give':103 'go':256 'god':110 'good':43,59,129,212 'grace':173 'great':26 'hand':150 'heart':188 'heaven':96 'hell':90 'hide':222 'human':71 'ill':61 'impart':174 'impious':201 'incens':312 'jehovah':21 'jove':22 'judg':165 'know':37,278 'land':161 'lead':251 'least':29 'left':68 'lent':213 'let':104,130,145,286,305 'life':261 'lord':24,136 'lot':271 'man':114,139 'mean':238 'merci':228,234 'natur':64,310 'obey':120 'oh':185,250 'one':303 'other':231 'paid':112 'peac':269 'prayer':3 'presum':151 'pride':199 'pursu':97 'quicken':246 'rais':308 'receiv':115 'right':171,178 'rise':313 'round':144,159 'sage':20 'saint':15 'savag':17 'save':194 'sea':301 'see':57,226 'sens':34 'show':232,235 'shun':92 'sinc':245 'sky':302 'space':297 'span':127 'st':279 'stay':180 'still':175 'sun':276 'teach':86,186,214 'templ':294 'thee':135,292 'thi':100,128,152,166,172,205,211,248,287 'think':134 'thou':25,41,277 'though':239 'thousand':141 'throw':155 'understood':30 'univers':2 'unknow':149 'warn':80 'way':193 'weak':148 'whereso':253 'wholli':243 'whose':293,298 'wisdom':206 'woe':220 'world':142 'wrong':184 'yet':49,121
549	Impromptu	209		\nIn vain you boast poetic names of yore, And cite those Sapphos we admire no more: Fate doomed the fall of every female wit; But doomed it then, when first Ardelia writ. Of all examples by the world confessed, I knew Ardelia could not quote the best; Who, like her mistress on Britannia’s throne, Fights and subdues in quarrels not her own. To write their praise you but in vain essay; Even while you write, you take that praise away. Light to the stars the sun does thus restore, But shines himself till they are seen no more. \n	'admir':15 'ardelia':32,43 'away':82 'best':48 'boast':5 'britannia':54 'cite':11 'confess':40 'could':44 'doom':19,27 'essay':73 'even':74 'everi':23 'exampl':36 'fall':21 'fate':18 'femal':24 'fight':57 'first':31 'impromptu':1 'knew':42 'light':83 'like':50 'mistress':52 'name':7 'poetic':6 'prais':68,81 'quarrel':61 'quot':46 'restor':91 'sappho':13 'seen':98 'shine':93 'star':86 'subdu':59 'sun':88 'take':79 'throne':56 'thus':90 'till':95 'vain':3,72 'wit':25 'world':39 'writ':33 'write':66,77 'yore':9

551	Epistle from Mrs. Yonge to Her Husband	249		\nThink not this paper comes with vain pretense\rTo move your pity, or to mourn th’ offense.\rToo well I know that hard obdurate heart;\rNo softening mercy there will take my part,\rNor can a woman’s arguments prevail,\rWhen even your patron’s wise example fails.\rBut this last privilege I still retain;\rTh’ oppressed and injured always may complain.\r   Too, too severely laws of honor bind\rThe weak submissive sex of womankind.\rIf sighs have gained or force compelled our hand,\rDeceived by art, or urged by stern command,\rWhatever motive binds the fatal tie,\rThe judging world expects our constancy.\r   Just heaven! (for sure in heaven does justice reign,\rThough tricks below that sacred name profane)\rTo you appealing I submit my cause.\rNor fear a judgment from impartial laws.\rAll bargains but conditional are made;\rThe purchase void, the creditor unpaid;\rDefrauded servants are from service free;\rA wounded slave regains his liberty.\rFor wives ill used no remedy remains,\rTo daily racks condemned, and to eternal chains.\r   From whence is this unjust distinction grown?\rAre we not formed with passions like your own?\rNature with equal fire our souls endued,\rOur minds as haughty, and as warm our blood;\rO’er the wide world your pleasures you pursue,\rThe change is justified by something new;\rBut we must sigh in silence—and be true.\rOur sex’s weakness you expose and blame\r(Of every prattling fop the common theme),\rYet from this weakness you suppose is due\rSublimer virtue than your Cato knew.\rHad heaven designed us trials so severe,\rIt would have formed our tempers then to bear.\r   And I have borne (oh what have I not borne!)\rThe pang of jealousy, the insults of scorn.\rWearied at length, I from your sight remove,\rAnd place my future hopes in secret love.\rIn the gay bloom of glowing youth retired,\rI quit the woman’s joy to be admired,\rWith that small pension your hard heart allows,\rRenounce your fortune, and release your vows.\rTo custom (though unjust) so much is due;\rI hide my frailty from the public view.\rMy conscience clear, yet sensible of shame,\rMy life I hazard, to preserve my fame.\rAnd I prefer this low inglorious state\rTo vile dependence on the thing I hate—\rBut you pursue me to this last retreat.\rDragged into light, my tender crime is shown\rAnd every circumstance of fondness known.\rBeneath the shelter of the law you stand,\rAnd urge my ruin with a cruel hand,\rWhile to my fault thus rigidly severe,\rTamely submissive to the man you fear.\r   This wretched outcast, this abandoned wife,\rHas yet this joy to sweeten shameful life:\rBy your mean conduct, infamously loose,\rYou are at once my accuser and excuse.\rLet me be damned by the censorious prude\r(Stupidly dull, or spiritually lewd),\rMy hapless case will surely pity find\rFrom every just and reasonable mind.\rWhen to the final sentence I submit,\rThe lips condemn me, but their souls aquit.\r   No more my husband, to your pleasures go,\rThe sweets of your recovered freedom know.\rGo: court the brittle friendship of the great,\rSmile at his board, or at his levee wait;\rAnd when dismissed, to madam’s toilet fly,\rMore than her chambermaids, or glasses, lie,\rTell her how young she looks, how heavenly fair,\rAdmire the lilies and the roses there.\rYour high ambition may be gratified,\rSome cousin of her own be made your bride,\rAnd you the father of a glorious race\rEndowed with Ch——l’s strength and Low——r’s face.\n	'abandon':451 'accus':472 'admir':333,572 'allow':341 'alway':67 'ambit':581 'appeal':130 'aquit':515 'argument':46 'art':94

552	HYMNS: My God! I Know, I Feel Thee Mine	250		\n1 My God! I know, I feel thee mine,    And will not quit my claim Till all I have is lost in thine,    And all renewed I am.                         2 I hold thee with a trembling hand,    But will not let thee go Till steadfastly by faith I stand,    And all thy goodness know.                         3 When shall I see the welcome hour    That plants my God in me! Spirit of health, and life, and power,    And perfect liberty!                         4 Jesu, thine all-victorious love    Shed in my heart abroad! Then shall my feet no longer rove,    Rooted and fixed in God.                         5 Love only can the conquest win,    The strength of sin subdue (Mine own unconquerable sin),    And form my soul anew.                         6 Love can bow down the stubborn neck,    The stone to flesh convert; Soften, and melt, and pierce, and break    An adamantine heart.                         7 Oh, that in me the sacred fire    Might now begin to glow, Burn up the dross of base desire,    And make the mountains flow!                         8 Oh, that it now from heaven might fall,    And all my sins consume! Come, Holy Ghost, for thee I call,    Spirit of burning, come!                         9 Refining fire, go through my heart,    Illuminate my soul; Scatter thy life through every part,    And sanctify the whole.                         10 Sorrow and sin shall then expire,    While, entered into rest, I only live my God t’admire—    My God forever blest.                         11 No longer then my heart shall mourn,    While purified by grace I only for his glory burn,    And always see his face.                         12 My steadfast soul, from falling free,    Shall then no longer move; But Christ be all the world to me,    And all my heart be love.\n	'1':10 '10':225 '11':247 '12':270 '2':38 '3':63 '4':87 '5':111 '6':132 '7':155 '8':180 '9':205 'abroad':98 'adamantin':153 'admir':242 'all-victori':90 'alway':266 'anew':131 'base':173 'begin':165 'blest':246 'bow':135 'break':151 'burn':168,203,264 'call':200 'christ':283 'claim':24 'come':194,204 'conquest':116 'consum':193 'convert':144 'desir':174 'dross':171 'enter':233 'everi':219 'expir':231 'face':269 'faith':55 'fall':188,275 'feel':7,16 'feet':102 'fire':162,207 'fix':108 'flesh':143 'flow':179 'forev':245 'form':128 'free':276 'ghost':196 'glori':263 'glow':167 'go':51,208 'god':3,12,74,110,240,244 'good':61 'grace':258 'hand':45 'health':79 'heart':97,154,211,252,293 'heaven':186 'hold':40 'holi':195 'hour':70 'hymn':1 'illumin':212 'jesu':88 'know':5,14,62 'let':49 'liberti':86 'life':81,217 'live':238 'longer':104,249,280 'lost':30 'love':93,112,133,295 'make':176 'melt':147 'might':163,187 'mine':9,18,123 'mountain':178 'mourn':254 'move':281 'neck':139 'oh':156,181 'part':220 'perfect':85 'pierc':149 'plant':72 'power':83 'purifi':256 'quit':22 'refin':206 'renew':35 'rest':235 'root':106 'rove':105 'sacr':161 'sanctifi':222 'scatter':215 'see':67,267 'shall':65,100,229,253,277 'shed':94 'sin':121,126,192,228 'soften':145 'sorrow':226 'soul':130,214,273 'spirit':77,201 'stand':57 'steadfast':53,272 'stone':141 'strength':119 'stubborn':138 'subdu':122 'thee':8,17,41,50,198 'thi':60,216 'thine':32,89 'till':25,52 'trembl':44 'unconquer':125 'victori':92 'welcom':69 'whole':224 'win':117 'world':287

It lifts the fainting spirits up,    It brings to life the dead; Our conflicts here shall soon be past, And you and I ascend at last    Triumphant with our head.                               5 The great mysterious Deity We soon with open face shall see;    The beatific sight Shall fill heaven’s sounding courts with praise, And wide diffuse the golden blaze    Of everlasting light.                               6 The Father shining on his throne, The glorious, co-eternal Son,    The Spirit, one and seven, Conspire our rapture to complete, And lo! we fall before his feet,    And silence heightens heaven.                               7 In hope of that ecstatic pause, Jesu, we now sustain the cross,    And at thy footstool fall, Till thou our hidden life reveal, Till thou our ravished spirits fill,    And God is all in all.\n	'1':8 '2':42 '3':80 '4':119 '5':156 '6':188 '7':222 'abod':59 'appear':92 'ascend':149 'awhil':25 'beatif':169 'beyond':33,43 'blaze':184 'bless':121 'bliss':123 'bliss-inspir':122 'bodi':23 'bound':45 'bring':133 'celesti':40 'co':198 'co-etern':197 'come':2,9 'complet':210 'comrad':16 'conflict':139 'conspir':206 'court':176 'cross':114,234 'crown':118 'dead':137 'deiti':160 'diffus':181 'distress':7,14 'eagl':64 'ecstat':227 'end':111 'endur':112 'etern':199 'everlast':186 'face':91,165 'faint':129 'faith':61,101 'fall':214,239 'father':190 'fear':30 'feel':24 'feet':217 'fill':172,251 'footstool':238 'forc':68 'forget':26 'forward':51 'glorious':196 'god':79,253 'golden':183 'great':158 'grief':28 'head':155 'heaven':54,173,221 'heighten':220 'hidden':243 'hill':41 'hope':125,224 'hymn':1 'inspir':124 'jesu':229 'last':151 'life':135,244 'lift':127 'light':187 'lo':212 'look':32,50 'master':85 'mount':77 'mysteri':159 'one':203 'open':164 'partner':5,12 'passag':70 'past':144 'patient':100 'paus':228 'pinion':65 'place':55 'prais':178 'prize':103 'raptur':208 'ravish':249 'reveal':245 'rise':66 'saint':57 'scale':75 'secur':58 'see':167 'seven':205 'shall':88,115,141,166,171 'shine':191 'side':96 'sight':170 'silenc':219 'sit':97 'sky':73 'son':200 'soon':142,162 'sound':175 'space':49 'spirit':130,202,250 'still':21 'strong':63 'suffer':82 'sure':105 'sustain':232 'tear':37 'thi':237 'thou':241,247 'thrice':120 'throne':194 'till':240,246 'time':47 'triumphant':152 'vale':35 'wear':116 'wide':180 'wilder':19
576	Facing into It	260		\nSo it is here, then, after so long, and after all— as the light turns in the leaves in the old golden  way of fall,                    as the small beasts dig to the place at the roots where survival waits, cowardly crouching  in the dark,                    as the branches begin to stretch into winter,  freed of their cheerful burden of green, then       it comes home, the flea-ridden bitch of desolation,  a thin dog with its ribs exposed like a lesson in mathematics, in subtraction; it comes home, to find its bowl  empty—then the numberless things for which to be grateful dissolve like the steam from a fire just doused with water on a day of overcast grays, lined by a cold slanting rain—                                      it is October, that season when Death  goes public, costumed, when the talking heads on the TV screen float up smiling at the terrible news, their skin alight with the same strange glow fish give off when they have been dead a week or more,  as the gas company adds odor for warning that the lines may be leaking, the sweet smell of disaster  hanging, invisible, in the air, a moment before you strike the match— it is then, brother, that I think of you, of your Caravaggio,  of the head of Goliath swung by its hair, wearing the artist’s own weary expression, exhausted of everything but its desire for that beautiful David he used to be; and I think  of all the boys walking the streets each carrying the severed head of the man he will become—and the way I bear it is to think of you, grinning, riding high in the cart leaving  the scene, a pair of huge horses hauling the wagon,  a fine mist rising from their damp shoulders,  unconcerned with what hangs, nailed to the museum walls—luckily the fall of Icarus has nothing to do with them,  nor the ruined Goliath who fell like a forest, nor the wretched Salomes with their blood-splattered  platters, nor the huge stone griffins sobbing at the gates to Valhalla as the litters are carried past ... the dark eyes of the horses are opaque with wisdom, their hoofs strike the pavements with such a musical decision,  the derisive curl of their lips is so like the mysterious  smile on the angel at Chartres, on Kuan Yin, on the dolphin,  as they pull the cart safe through the blizzards  of Main Street, the snow slowly swallowing the signs  though the crossing light beckons— a soft glowing green like some spectral Eden  in the blank white swirl of the storm. The stallion neighs once, sends a warm cloud  of breath into the snow-filled air, and the mare isn’t scared yet—at least  she’s still pulling. There’s a barn out there  somewhere, as they plow through the light’s  yellow aura of caution, its warm glow foretelling what hides in the storm: a stall full of gold, where the soul— that magician—can wallow and winter in straw.\n	'add':177 'air':196,456 'alight':155 'angel':393 'artist':227 'aura':485 'barn':473 'bear':271 'beast':32 'beauti':240 'beckon':424 'becom':266 'begin':51 'bitch':71 'blank':435 'blizzard':410 'blood':339 'blood-splatt':338 'bowl':94 'boy':252 'branch':50 'breath':450 'brother':207 'burden':60 'caravaggio':215 'carri':257,357 'cart':283,406 'caution':487 'chartr':395 'cheer':59 'cloud':448 'cold':125 'come':65,89 'compani':176 'costum':137 'coward':43 'cross':422 'crouch':44 'curl':381 'damp':301 'dark':47,360 'david':241 'day':118 'dead':168 'death':134 'decis':378 'deris':380 'desir':237 'desol':73 'dig':33 'disast':191 'dissolv':105 'dog':76 'dolphin':401 'dous':113 'eden':432 'empti':95 'everyth':234 'exhaust':232 'expos':80 'express':231 'eye':361 'face':1 'fall':28,314 'fell':328 'fill':455 'find':92 'fine':296 'fire':111 'fish':161 'flea':69 'flea-ridden':68 'float':146 'forest':331 'foretel':491 'freed':56 'full':499 'gas':175 'gate':350 'give':162 'glow':160,427,490 'goe':135 'gold':501 'golden':25 'goliath':220,326 'grate':104 'gray':121 'green':62,428 'griffin':346 'grin':278 'hair':224 'hang':192,306 'haul':292 'head':141,218,260 'hide':493 'high':280 'home':66,90 'hoof':370 'hors':291,364 'huge':290,344 'icarus':316 'invis':193 'isn':460 'kuan':397 'leak':186 'least':465 'leav':21,284 'lesson':83 'light':17,423,482 'like':81,106,329,387,429 'line':122,183 'lip':384 'litter':355 'long':11 'luckili':312 'magician':506 'main':412 'man':263 'mare':459 'match':203 'mathemat':85 'may':184 'mist':297 'moment':198 'museum':310 'music':377 'mysteri':389 'nail':307 'neigh':443 'news':152 'noth':318 'numberless':98 'octob':130 'odor':178 'old':24 'opaqu':366 'overcast':120 'pair':288 'past':358 'pavement':373 'place':36 'platter':341 'plow':479 'public':136 'pull':404,469 'rain':127 'rib':79 'ridden':70 'ride':279 'rise':298 'root':39 'ruin':325 'safe':407 'salom':335 'scare':462 'scene':286 'screen':145 'season':132 'send':445 'sever':259 'shoulder':302 'sign':419 'skin':154 'slant':126 'slowli':416 'small':31 'smell':189 'smile':148,390 'snow':415,454 'snow-fil':453 'sob':347 'soft':426 'somewher':476 'soul':504 'spectral':431 'splatter':340 'stall':498 'stallion':442 'steam':108 'still':468 'stone':345 'storm':440,496 'strang':159 'straw':512 'street':255,413 'stretch':53 'strike':201,371 'subtract':87 'surviv':41 'swallow':417 'sweet':188 'swirl':437 'swung':221 'talk':140 'terribl':151 'thin':75 'thing':99 'think':210,248,275 'though':420 'turn':18 'tv':144 'unconcern':303 'use':243 'valhalla':352 'wagon':294 'wait':42 'walk':253 'wall':311 'wallow':508 'warm':447,489 'warn':180 'water':115 'way':26,269 'wear':225 'weari':230 'week':170 'white':436 'winter':55,510 'wisdom':368 'wretch':334 'yellow':484 'yet':463 'yin':398
577	The Messenger	260		\nThe messenger runs, not carrying the news  of victory, or defeat; the messenger, unresting,    has always been running, the wind before and behind him,     across the turning back of earth, leaving       his tracks across the plains, his ropes        hanging from the ledges of mountains;          for centuries, millennia, he has been running        carrying whatever it is that cannot be       put down: it is rolled in a tube     made of hide, carefully, to keep it dry    as he runs, through storms and monsoons, sometimes on foot, sometimes poling a boat   through a flooded mangrove swamp, or     setting stiff sails to cross from island to island     running before the wind. In some ages, peasants       have helped him—bringing him small cakes        of rice wrapped in the weeds of the sea and          new sandals woven of hemp for his torn        bleeding feet; sometimes in the heat of noon       they would offer a drink of rosewater, sometimes    a coat of fur against the winter snows;  and sometimes at night, he would rest  by a fire where voices wove with the music    of gut-strings, or with mountain pipes whose     sound was like wind through the bones       of creation—and he would be cheered        by the company of others, the firelit glow          of their faces like a bright raft afloat in the dark;        at times, rumors spread of his death, scholars       analyzed his obsession, dated his bones, his prayer bundle;    but at dawn, he always arose, in the mists, in the blur of so many mornings, so many shoes  worn into scraps and discarded, so many     the cities that burned as he passed     them, so many the skulls abandoned       by armies, so many whose blood        stained the threads of their prayer rugs,           so many, so many, so many—       oh,     and that green, sunlit hill that kept    rising from the dark waters of flood, outlined bright   against the sky, the odds, the evidence— and he, the messenger,  running through history, carries this small tube,    its durable hide—carries it, not like      a torch, no, nothing so blazing;       not like the brass lamp that summons        a genie, no magic wishes;       not like the candles that hope sets aflame     and a breath can extinguish ... no.  He carried it like    what has no likeness,     what is curled up inside and       he swore he could feel it, though        perhaps he had dreamed it, still          at times, stopping under some tree        or other, when the night was warm,       so close the stars seemed to breathe in     the branches, he would lie quiet,   then it would seem that whatever it was in there  would pulse softly with light, a code     only the heart could break     (but of course he couldn’t say       for he was only the messenger)—     and at sunrise, wearily, he would rise        to his feet and trudge on, sometimes         running, sometimes stumbling,          carrying whatever it was that could not           be put down, would not be cast aside—          and besides, he would chide himself,         weren’t they all as tired as he,       and hadn’t they helped him, time     and again, on his way?\n	'abandon':276 'across':27,36 'aflam':363 'afloat':217 'age':112 'alway':18,242 'analyz':229 'armi':278 'aros':243 'asid':490 'back':30 'behind':25 'besid':492 'blaze':343 'bleed':139 'blood':282 'blur':249 'boat':90 'bone':194,234 'branch':419 'brass':347 'break':445 'breath':366,416 'bright':215,312 'bring':117 'bundl':237 'burn':267 'cake':120 'candl':359 'cannot':59 'care':72 'carri':7,54,327,334,371,476 'cast':489 'centuri':48 'cheer':201 'chide':495 'citi':265 'close':411 'coat':156 'code':440 'compani':204 'could':387,444,481 'couldn':450 'cours':448 'creation':196 'cross':101 'curl':380 'dark':220,307 'date':232 'dawn':240 'death':227 'defeat':13 'discard':261 'dream':394 'dri':76 'drink':151 'durabl':332 'earth':32 'evid':319 'extinguish':368 'face':212 'feel':388 'feet':140,468 'fire':172 'firelit':208 'flood':93,310 'foot':86 'fur':158 'geni':352 'glow':209 'green':299 'gut':181 'gut-str':180 'hadn':506 'hang':41 'heart':443 'heat':144 'help':115,509 'hemp':135 'hide':71,333 'hill':301 'histori':326 'hope':361 'insid':382 'island':103,105 'keep':74 'kept':303 'lamp':348 'leav':33 'ledg':44 'lie':422 'light':438 'like':190,213,337,345,357,373,377 'made':69 'magic':354 'mangrov':94 'mani':252,255,263,273,280,291,293,295 'messeng':2,4,15,323,458 'millennia':49 'mist':246 'monsoon':83 'morn':253 'mountain':46,185 'music':178 'new':131 'news':9 'night':166,407 'noon':146 'noth':341 'obsess':231 'odd':317 'offer':149 'oh':296 'other':206 'outlin':311 'pass':270 'peasant':113 'perhap':391 'pipe':186 'plain':38 'pole':88 'prayer':236,288 'puls':435 'put':61,484 'quiet':423 'raft':216 'rest':169 'rice':122 'rise':304,465 'roll':65 'rope':40 'rosewat':153 'rug':289 'rumor':223 'run':5,20,53,79,106,324,473 'sail':99 'sandal':132 'say':452 'scholar':228 'scrap':259 'sea':129 'seem':414,427 'set':97,362 'shoe':256 'skull':275 'sky':315 'small':119,329 'snow':162 'soft':436 'sometim':84,87,141,154,164,472,474 'sound':188 'spread':224 'stain':283 'star':413 'stiff':98 'still':396 'stop':399 'storm':81 'string':182 'stumbl':475 'summon':350 'sunlit':300 'sunris':461 'swamp':95 'swore':385 'though':390 'thread':285 'time':222,398,511 'tire':502 'torch':339 'torn':138 'track':35 'tree':402 'trudg':470 'tube':68,330 'turn':29 'unrest':16 'victori':11 'voic':174 'warm':409 'water':308 'way':516 'wearili':462 'weed':126 'weren':497 'whatev':55,429,477 'whose':187,281 'wind':22,109,191 'winter':161 'wish':355 'worn':257 'would':148,168,199,421,426,434,464,486,494 'wove':175 'woven':133 'wrap':123
578	Reading the Bible Backwards	260		\nAll around the altar, huge lianas curled, unfurled the dark green of their leaves to complement the red of blood spilled there—a kind of Christmas  decoration, overhung with heavy vines and over them, the stars. When the angels came, messengers like birds  but with the oiled flesh of men, they hung  over the scene with smoldering swords,  splashing the world when they beat their rain-soaked wings against the turning sky. The child was bright in his basket as a lemon, with a bitter smell from his wet  swaddling clothes. His mother bent  above him, singing a lullaby in the liquid tongue invented for the very young—short syllables  like dripping from an eave mixed with the first big drops of rain  that fell, like tiny silver pears, from the glistening fronds of palm. The three  who gathered there—old kings uncrowned:  the cockroach, condor, and the leopard, lords of the cracks below the ground, the mountain  pass and the grass-grown plain—were not  adorned, did not bear gifts, had not  come to adore; they were simply drawn  to gawk at this recurrent, awkward son  whom the wind had said would spell  the end of earth as it had been. Somewhere north of this familiar scene  the polar caps were melting, the water was  advancing in its slow, relentless lines, swallowing the old landmarks, swelling the seas that pulled the flowers and the great steel cities down.  The dolphins sport in the rising sea,  anemones wave their many arms like hair  on a drowned gorgon’s head, her features  softened by the sea beyond all recognition. On the desert’s edge where the oasis dies in a wash of sand, the sphinx seems to shift on her haunches of stone, and the rain, as it runs down,  completes the ruin of her face. The Nile merges with the sea, the waters rise and drown the noise of earth. At the forest’s edge, where the child sleeps, the waters gather— as if a hand were reaching for the curtain to drop across the glowing, lit tableau. When the waves closed over, completing the green  sweep of ocean, there was no time for mourning.  No final trump, no thunder to announce the silent steal of waters; how soundlessly it all went under: the little family and the scene so easily mistaken for an adoration. Above, more clouds poured in  and closed their ranks across the skies; the angels, who had seemed so solid, turned  quicksilver in the rain.                                      Now, nothing but the wind  moves on the rain-pocked face of the swollen waters, though far below where giant squid lie hidden in shy tangles,  the whales, heavy-bodied as the angels,  their fins like vestiges of wings, sing some mighty epic of their own— a great day when the ships would all withdraw,  the harpoons fail of their aim, the land  dissolve into the waters, and they would swim  among the peaks of mountains, like eagles  of the deep, while far below them, the old  nightmares of earth would settle into silt among the broken cities, the empty  basket of the child would float abandoned in the seaweed until the work of water  unraveled it in filaments of straw, till even that straw rotted in the planetary thaw the whales prayed for,  sending their jets of water skyward  in the clear conviction they’d spill back  to ocean with their will accomplished  in the miracle of rain: And the earth  was without form and void, and darkness  was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit moved upon the face of the waters.

554	On the Death of Dr. Robert Levet	251		\nCondemned to Hope’s delusive mine,     As on we toil from day to day, By sudden blasts, or slow decline,     Our social comforts drop away. Well tried through many a varying year,     See Levet to the grave descend; Officious, innocent, sincere,     Of every friendless name the friend. Yet still he fills Affection’s eye,     Obscurely wise, and coarsely kind; Nor, lettered Arrogance, deny     Thy praise to merit unrefined. When fainting Nature called for aid,     And hovering Death prepared the blow, His vigorous remedy displayed     The power of art without the show. In Misery’s darkest cavern known,     His useful care was ever nigh, Where hopeless Anguish poured his groan,     And lonely Want retired to die. No summons mocked by chill delay,     No petty gain disdained by pride, The modest wants of every day     The toil of every day supplied. His virtues walked their narrow round,     Nor made a pause, nor left a void; And sure the Eternal Master found     The single talent well employed. The busy day, the peaceful night,     Unfelt, uncounted, glided by; His frame was firm, his powers were bright,     Though now his eightieth year was nigh. Then with no throbbing fiery pain,     No cold gradations of decay, Death broke at once the vital chain,     And freed his soul the nearest way.\n	'affect':59 'aid':81 'anguish':113 'arrog':69 'art':95 'away':32 'blast':24 'blow':87 'bright':189 'broke':209 'busi':173 'call':79 'care':107 'cavern':103 'chain':214 'chill':127 'coars':65 'cold':204 'comfort':30 'condemn':8 'darkest':102 'day':19,21,140,145,174 'death':3,84,208 'decay':207 'declin':27 'delay':128 'delus':12 'deni':70 'descend':45 'die':122 'disdain':132 'display':91 'dr':5 'drop':31 'eightieth':193 'employ':171 'etern':164 'ever':109 'everi':50,139,144 'eye':61 'faint':77 'fieri':201 'fill':58 'firm':185 'found':166 'frame':183 'freed':216 'friend':54 'friendless':51 'gain':131 'glide':180 'gradat':205 'grave':44 'groan':116 'hope':10 'hopeless':112 'hover':83 'innoc':47 'kind':66 'known':104 'left':158 'letter':68 'levet':7,41 'lone':118 'made':154 'mani':36 'master':165 'merit':74 'mine':13 'miseri':100 'mock':125 'modest':136 'name':52 'narrow':151 'natur':78 'nearest':220 'nigh':110,196 'night':177 'obscur':62 'offici':46 'pain':202 'paus':156 'peac':176 'petti':130 'pour':114 'power':93,187 'prais':72 'prepar':85 'pride':134 'remedi':90 'retir':120 'robert':6 'round':152 'see':40 'show':98 'sincer':48 'singl':168 'slow':26 'social':29 'soul':218 'still':56 'sudden':23 'summon':124 'suppli':146 'sure':162 'talent':169 'thi':71 'though':190 'throb':200 'toil':17,142 'tri':34 'uncount':179 'unfelt':178 'unrefin':75 'use':106 'vari':38 'vigor':89 'virtu':148 'vital':213 'void':160 'walk':149 'want':119,137 'way':221 'well':33,170 'wise':63 'without':96 'year':39,194 'yet':55
555	Psalm 58	252		\nYe congregation of the tribes,     On justice do you set your mind; And are ye free from guile and bribes    Ye judges of mankind? Nay, ye of frail and mortal mould    Imagine mischief in your heart; Your suffrages and selves are sold    Unto the general mart. Men of unrighteous seed betray    Perverseness from their mother’s womb; As soon as they can run astray,    Against the truth presume. They are with foul infection stained,    Ev’n with the serpent’s taint impure; Their ears to blest persuasion chained,    And locked against her lure. Though Christ himself the pipe should tune,    They will not to the measure tread, Nor will they with his grief commune    Though tears of blood he shed. Lord, humanize their scoff and scorn,    And their malevolence defeat; Of water and the spirit born    Let grace their change complete. Let them with pious ardor burn,    And make thy holy church their choice; To thee with all their passions turn,    And in thy light rejoice. As quick as lightning to its mark,    So let thy gracious angel speed; And take their spirits in thine ark    To their eternal mead. The righteous shall exult the more    As he such powerful mercy sees, Such wrecks and ruins safe on shore,    Such tortured souls at ease. So that a man shall say, no doubt,    The penitent has his reward; There is a God to bear him out,    And he is Christ our Lord.\n	'58':2 'angel':180 'ardor':148 'ark':188 'astray':66 'bear':235 'betray':53 'blest':88 'blood':120 'born':138 'bribe':22 'burn':149 'chain':90 'chang':142 'choic':156 'christ':97,241 'church':154 'commune':116 'complet':143 'congreg':4 'defeat':132 'doubt':224 'ear':86 'eas':216 'etern':191 'ev':77 'exult':196 'foul':74 'frail':30 'free':18 'general':47 'god':233 'grace':140 'gracious':179 'grief':115 'guil':20 'heart':38 'holi':153 'human':124 'imagin':34 'impur':84 'infect':75 'judg':24 'justic':9 'let':139,144,177 'light':167 'lightn':172 'lock':92 'lord':123,243 'lure':95 'make':151 'malevol':131 'man':220 'mankind':26 'mark':175 'mart':48 'mead':192 'measur':108 'men':49 'merci':203 'mind':14 'mischief':35 'mortal':32 'mother':57 'mould':33 'n':78 'nay':27 'passion':162 'penit':226 'persuas':89 'pervers':54 'pious':147 'pipe':100 'power':202 'presum':70 'psalm':1 'quick':170 'rejoic':168 'reward':229 'righteous':194 'ruin':208 'run':65 'safe':209 'say':222 'scoff':126 'scorn':128 'see':204 'seed':52 'selv':42 'serpent':81 'set':12 'shall':195,221 'shed':122 'shore':211 'sold':44 'soon':61 'soul':214 'speed':181 'spirit':137,185 'stain':76 'suffrag':40 'taint':83 'take':183 'tear':118 'thee':158 'thi':152,166,178 'thine':187 'though':96,117 'tortur':213 'tread':109 'tribe':7 'truth':69 'tune':102 'turn':163 'unright':51 'unto':45 'water':134 'womb':59 'wreck':206 'ye':3,17,23,28
556	Psalm 114	252		\nWhen Israel came from Egypt’s coast,    And Goshen’s marshy plains, And Jacob with his joyful host    From servitude and chains; Then was it seen how much the Jews    Were holy in his sight, And God did Israel’s kingdom choose    To manifest his might. The sea beheld it, and with dread    Retreated to make way; And Jordan to his fountain head    Ran backwards in dismay. The mountains, like the rams that bound,    Exulted on their base; Like lambs the little hills around    Skipt lightly from their place. What is the cause, thou mighty sea,    That thou thyself should shun; And Jordan, what is come to thee,    That thou should backward run? Ye mountains that ye leaped so high    From off the solid rock, Ye hills that ye should gambols try,    Like firstlings of the flock? Earth, from the center to the sod    His fearful presence hail The presence of Jeshurun’s God,    In whom our arms prevail. Who beds of rocks in pools to stand    Can by his word compel, And from the veiny flint command    The fountain and the well.\n	'114':2 'arm':160 'around':86 'backward':67,114 'base':80 'bed':163 'beheld':51 'bound':76 'came':5 'caus':95 'center':143 'chain':24 'choos':44 'coast':9 'come':108 'command':180 'compel':174 'dismay':69 'dread':55 'earth':140 'egypt':7 'exult':77 'fear':148 'firstl':136 'flint':179 'flock':139 'fountain':64,182 'gambol':133 'god':39,156 'goshen':11 'hail':150 'head':65 'high':122 'hill':85,129 'holi':34 'host':20 'israel':4,41 'jacob':16 'jeshurun':154 'jew':32 'jordan':61,105 'joy':19 'kingdom':43 'lamb':82 'leap':120 'light':88 'like':72,81,135 'littl':84 'make':58 'manifest':46 'marshi':13 'might':48 'mighti':97 'mountain':71,117 'much':30 'place':91 'plain':14 'pool':167 'presenc':149,152 'prevail':161 'psalm':1 'ram':74 'ran':66 'retreat':56 'rock':127,165 'run':115 'sea':50,98 'seen':28 'servitud':22 'shun':103 'sight':37 'skipt':87 'sod':146 'solid':126 'stand':169 'thee':110 'thou':96,100,112 'thyself':101 'tri':134 'veini':178 'way':59 'well':185 'word':173 'ye':116,119,128,131
557	Epitaph on a Hare	253		\nHere lies, whom hound did ne’er pursue,     Nor swifter greyhound follow, Whose foot ne’er tainted morning dew,     Nor ear heard huntsman’s hallo’, Old Tiney, surliest of his kind,     Who, nursed with tender care, And to domesticate bounds confined,     Was still a wild jack-hare. Though duly from my hand he took     His pittance every night, He did it with a jealous look,     And, when he could, would bite. His diet was of wheaten bread,     And milk, and oats, and straw, Thistles, or lettuces instead,     With sand to scour his maw. On twigs of hawthorn he regaled,     On pippins’ russet peel; And, when his juicy salads failed,     Sliced carrot pleased him well. A Turkey carpet was his lawn,     Whereon he loved to bound, To skip and gambol like a fawn,     And swing his rump around. His frisking was at evening hours,     For then he lost his fear; But most before approaching showers,     Or when a storm drew near. Eight years and five round-rolling moons     He thus saw steal away, Dozing out all his idle noons,     And every night at play. I kept him for his humor’s sake,     For he would oft beguile My heart of thoughts that made it ache,     And force me to a smile. But now, beneath this walnut-shade     He finds his long, last home, And waits in snug concealment laid,     Till gentler Puss shall come. He, still more agèd, feels the shocks     From which no care can save, And, partner once of Tiney’s box,     Must soon partake his grave.\n	'ach':210 'agèd':244 'approach':158 'around':142 'away':178 'beguil':202 'beneath':219 'bite':76 'bound':44,130 'box':260 'bread':82 'care':40,251 'carpet':122 'carrot':116 'come':240 'conceal':234 'confin':45 'could':74 'dew':23 'diet':78 'domest':43 'doze':179 'drew':164 'duli':54 'ear':25 'eight':166 'epitaph':1 'er':11,20 'even':147 'everi':62,186 'fail':114 'fawn':137 'fear':154 'feel':245 'find':225 'five':169 'follow':16 'foot':18 'forc':212 'frisk':144 'gambol':134 'gentler':237 'grave':265 'greyhound':15 'hallo':29 'hand':57 'hare':4,52 'hawthorn':102 'heard':26 'heart':204 'home':229 'hound':8 'hour':148 'humor':195 'huntsman':27 'idl':183 'instead':92 'jack':51 'jack-har':50 'jealous':69 'juici':112 'kept':191 'kind':35 'laid':235 'last':228 'lawn':125 'lettuc':91 'lie':6 'like':135 'long':227 'look':70 'lost':152 'love':128 'made':208 'maw':98 'milk':84 'moon':173 'morn':22 'must':261 'ne':10,19 'near':165 'night':63,187 'noon':184 'nurs':37 'oat':86 'oft':201 'old':30 'partak':263 'partner':255 'peel':108 'pippin':106 'pittanc':61 'play':189 'pleas':117 'pursu':12 'puss':238 'regal':104 'roll':172 'round':171 'round-rol':170 'rump':141 'russet':107 'sake':197 'salad':113 'sand':94 'save':253 'saw':176 'scour':96 'shade':223 'shall':239 'shock':247 'shower':159 'skip':132 'slice':115 'smile':216 'snug':233 'soon':262 'steal':177 'still':47,242 'storm':163 'straw':88 'surliest':32 'swifter':14 'swing':139 'taint':21 'tender':39 'thistl':89 'though':53 'thought':206 'thus':175 'till':236 'tiney':31,258 'took':59 'turkey':121 'twig':100 'wait':231 'walnut':222 'walnut-shad':221 'well':119 'wheaten':81 'whereon':126 'whose':17 'wild':49 'would':75,200 'year':167
579	The Last Man	260		\nHere, in our familiar streets, the day  is brisk with winter’s business. The reassuring rows of brick façades,  litter baskets overflowing with the harvest of the streets and, when the light turns, the people  move in unison, the cars miraculously  slide to a stop, no one is killed,  the streets, for some reason, do not  show the blood that is pouring  like a tide, on other shores.          Martinez, the last peasant left alive           in his village, refuses to run, hopes           that God, El Salvador,          will let him get the harvest in.          “Can a fish live out of water?” he says           for why he stays, and weeds          another row, ignoring the fins           of sharks that push up          through the furrows. Here, it is said, we live in the belly of the beast. Ahab sits forever at the helm, his skin white wax, an effigy. The whale carries  him, lashed to its side by the ropes from his own harpoon. His eyes are dead. His ivory leg juts from the flank of Leviathan like a useless tooth.          One more time, the distant sail appears,           a cloud forms, an old icon for mercy           turned up in a dusty corner          of the sky, preparing rain          for the parched land, Rachel          weeping for her children. “Can a fish           live out of water?” he asks          and the rain answers, in Spanish,           manitas de plata          little hands of silver on his brow.\n	'ahab':136 'aliv':77 'anoth':111 'answer':227 'appear':186 'ask':223 'basket':24 'beast':135 'belli':132 'blood':62 'brick':21 'brisk':12 'brow':239 'busi':16 'car':43 'carri':150 'children':214 'cloud':188 'corner':200 'day':10 'de':231 'dead':166 'distant':184 'dusti':199 'effigi':147 'el':87 'eye':164 'familiar':7 'façad':22 'fin':115 'fish':98,217 'flank':173 'forev':138 'form':189 'furrow':123 'get':92 'god':86 'hand':234 'harpoon':162 'harvest':28,94 'helm':141 'hope':84 'icon':192 'ignor':113 'ivori':168 'jut':170 'kill':52 'land':209 'lash':152 'last':2,74 'left':76 'leg':169 'let':90 'leviathan':175 'light':35 'like':66,176 'litter':23 'littl':233 'live':99,129,218 'man':3 'manita':230 'martinez':72 'merci':194 'miracul':44 'move':39 'old':191 'one':50,180 'overflow':25 'parch':208 'peasant':75 'peopl':38 'plata':232 'pour':65 'prepar':204 'push':119 'rachel':210 'rain':205,226 'reason':57 'reassur':18 'refus':81 'rope':158 'row':19,112 'run':83 'said':127 'sail':185 'salvador':88 'say':104 'shark':117 'shore':71 'show':60 'side':155 'silver':236 'sit':137 'skin':143 'sky':203 'slide':45 'spanish':229 'stay':108 'stop':48 'street':8,31,54 'tide':68 'time':182 'tooth':179 'turn':36,195 'unison':41 'useless':178 'villag':80 'water':102,221 'wax':145 'weed':110 'weep':211 'whale':149 'white':144 'winter':14
558	Hatred and Vengeance, My Eternal Portion	253		\nHatred and vengeance, my eternal portion, Scarce can endure delay of execution, Wait, with impatient readiness, to seize my                            Soul in a moment. Damned below Judas: more abhorred than he was, Who for a few pence sold his holy master. Twice betrayed, Jesus me, the last delinquent,                            Deems the profanest.

562	Crepuscule with Muriel	255		\nInstead of a cup of tea, instead of a milk- silk whelk of a cup, of a cup of nearly six o'clock teatime, cup of a stumbling block, cup of an afternoon unredeemed by talk, cup of a cut brown loaf, of a slice, a lack of butter, blueberry jam that's almost black, instead of tannin seeping into the cracks of a pot, the void of an hour seeps out, infects the slit of a cut I haven't the wit to fix with a surgeon's needle threaded with fine-gauge silk as a key would thread the cylinder of a lock. But no key threads the cylinder of a lock. Late afternoon light, transitory, licks the place of the absent cup with its rough tongue, flicks itself out beneath the wheel's revolving spoke. Taut thought's gone, with a blink of attention, slack, a vision of "death and distance in the mix" (she lost her words and how did she get them back when the corridor of a day was a lurching deck? The dream-life logic encodes in nervous tics she translated to a syntax which connects intense and unfashionable politics with morning coffee, Hudson sunsets, sex; then the short-circuit of the final stroke, the end toward which all lines looped out, then broke). What a gaze out the window interjects: on the southeast corner, a black Lab balks, tugged as the light clicks green toward a late-day walk by a plump brown girl in a purple anorak.

564	What He Thought	119		\nWe were supposed to do a job in Italy and, full of our feeling for ourselves (our sense of being Poets from America) we went from Rome to Fano, met the mayor, mulled a couple matters over (what's a cheap date, they asked us; what's flat drink). Among Italian literati we could recognize our counterparts: the academic, the apologist, the arrogant, the amorous, the brazen and the glib—and there was one administrator (the conservative), in suit of regulation gray, who like a good tour guide with measured pace and uninflected tone narrated sights and histories the hired van hauled us past. Of all, he was the most politic and least poetic, so it seemed. Our last few days in Rome (when all but three of the New World Bards had flown) I found a book of poems this unprepossessing one had written: it was there in the pensione room (a room he'd recommended) where it must have been abandoned by the German visitor (was there a bus of them?) to whom he had inscribed and dated it a month before. I couldn't read Italian, either, so I put the book back into the wardrobe's dark. We last Americans were due to leave tomorrow. For our parting evening then our host chose something in a family restaurant, and there we sat and chatted, sat and chewed, till, sensible it was our last big chance to be poetic, make our mark, one of us asked                                              "What's poetry?" Is it the fruits and vegetables and marketplace of Campo dei Fiori, or the statue there?" Because I was the glib one, I identified the answer instantly, I didn't have to think—"The truth is both, it's both," I blurted out. But that was easy. That was easiest to say. What followed taught me something about difficulty, for our underestimated host spoke out, all of a sudden, with a rising passion, and he said: The statue represents Giordano Bruno, brought to be burned in the public square because of his offense against authority, which is to say the Church. His crime was his belief the universe does not revolve around the human being: God is no fixed point or central government, but rather is poured in waves through all things. All things move. "If God is not the soul itself, He is the soul of the soul of the world." Such was his heresy. The day they brought him forth to die, they feared he might incite the crowd (the man was famous for his eloquence). And so his captors placed upon his face an iron mask, in which he could not speak. That's how they burned him. That is how he died: without a word, in front of everyone.                      And poetry—                                         (we'd all put down our forks by now, to listen to the man in gray; he went on softly)—                   poetry is what he thought, but did not say.\n	'abandon':166 'academ':62 'administr':78 'america':26 'american':207 'among':53 'amor':68 'answer':281 'apologist':64 'around':367 'arrog':66 'ask':47,252 'author':350 'back':199 'bard':135 'belief':361 'big':241 'blurt':297 'book':141,198 'brazen':70 'brought':337,415 'bruno':336 'burn':340,455 'bus':174 'campo':265 'captor':437 'central':377 'chanc':242 'chat':231 'cheap':44 'chew':234 'chose':220 'church':356 'conserv':80 'could':57,448 'couldn':189 'counterpart':60 'coupl':38 'crime':358 'crowd':426 'd':159,472 'dark':204 'date':45,183 'day':124,413 'dei':266 'didn':284 'die':419,461 'difficulti':314 'drink':52 'due':209 'easi':302 'easiest':305 'either':193 'eloqu':433 'even':216 'everyon':468 'face':441 'famili':224 'famous':430 'fano':32 'fear':421 'feel':17 'fiori':267 'fix':374 'flat':51 'flown':137 'follow':309 'fork':477 'forth':417 'found':139 'front':466 'fruit':259 'full':14 'german':169 'giordano':335 'glib':73,276 'god':371,392 'good':89 'govern':378 'gray':85,486 'guid':91 'haul':105 'heresi':411 'hire':103 'histori':101 'host':219,318 'human':369 'identifi':279 'incit':424 'inscrib':181 'instant':282 'iron':443 'itali':12 'italian':54,192 'job':10 'last':122,206,240 'least':116 'leav':211 'like':87 'listen':481 'literati':55 'make':246 'man':428,484 'mark':248 'marketplac':263 'mask':444 'matter':39 'mayor':35 'measur':93 'met':33 'might':423 'month':186 'move':390 'mull':36 'must':163 'narrat':98 'new':133 'offens':348 'one':77,146,249,277 'pace':94 'part':215 'passion':328 'past':107 'pension':154 'place':438 'poem':143 'poet':24 'poetic':117,245 'poetri':255,470,491 'point':375 'polit':114 'pour':382 'public':343 'put':196,474 'rather':380 'read':191 'recogn':58 'recommend':160 'regul':84 'repres':334 'restaur':225 'revolv':366 'rise':327 'rome':30,126 'room':155,157 'said':331 'sat':229,232 'say':307,354,499 'seem':120 'sens':21 'sensibl':236 'sight':99 'soft':490 'someth':221,312 'soul':396,401,404 'speak':450 'spoke':319 'squar':344 'statu':270,333 'sudden':324 'suit':82 'suppos':6 'taught':310 'thing':387,389 'think':288 'thought':3,495 'three':130 'till':235 'tomorrow':212 'tone':97 'tour':90 'truth':290 'underestim':317 'uninflect':96 'univers':363 'unprepossess':145 'upon':439 'us':48,106,251 'van':104 'veget':261 'visitor':170 'wardrob':202 'wave':384 'went':28,488 'without':462 'word':464 'world':134,407 'written':148

569	Sitting Outside at the End of Autumn	258		\nThree years ago, in the afternoons,                                             I used to sit back here and try To answer the simple arithmetic of my life, But never could figure it— This object and that object Never contained the landscape                                                           nor all of its implications, This tree and that shrub Never completely satisfied the sum or quotient I took from or carried to,                                                nor do they do so now, Though I'm back here again, looking to calculate, Looking to see what adds up. Everything comes from something,                                            only something comes from nothing, Lao Tzu says, more or less. Eminently sensible, I say, Rubbing this tiny snail shell between my thumb and two fingers. Delicate as an earring,                                           it carries its emptiness like a child It would be rid of. I rub it clockwise and counterclockwise, hoping for anything Resplendent in its vocabulary or disguise— But one and one make nothing, he adds,                                                                            endless and everywhere, The shadow that everything casts.\n	'add':86,156 'afternoon':13 'ago':10 'answer':23 'anyth':142 'arithmet':26 'autumn':7 'back':18,76 'calcul':81 'carri':65,123 'cast':164 'child':128 'clockwis':137 'come':89,94 'complet':55 'contain':41 'could':32 'counterclockwis':139 'delic':118 'disguis':148 'earring':121 'emin':103 'empti':125 'end':5 'endless':157 'everyth':88,163 'everywher':159 'figur':33 'finger':117 'hope':140 'implic':48 'landscap':43 'lao':97 'less':102 'life':29 'like':126 'look':79,82 'm':75 'make':153 'never':31,40,54 'noth':96,154 'object':36,39 'one':150,152 'outsid':2 'quotient':60 'resplend':143 'rid':132 'rub':107,135 'satisfi':56 'say':99,106 'see':84 'sensibl':104 'shadow':161 'shell':111 'shrub':53 'simpl':25 'sit':1,17 'snail':110 'someth':91,93 'sum':58 'though':73 'three':8 'thumb':114 'tini':109 'took':62 'tree':50 'tri':21 'two':116 'tzu':98 'use':15 'vocabulari':146 'would':130 'year':9

571	Lyre	123		\nBefore anything could happen, flecks of real gold on her mouth, her eyes more convex than any others, the ground spoke, the barrier of lilacs spoke. What sang in the black tree was entirely gold. Her chair was empty. New absence is a great figure dark as the underskin of fruit. At the center of the earth it surrounds and amplifies the dead whose music never slows down. She came by car. I came by train. We embraced. It was at the foot of a hill steeply crowned with apples and a ruined fortress. Imagination did not make the world. Sweetness is the entire portion. Before anything could happen, happiness, the necessary precondition of the world, spoke and flowered over the hill. When I was in Hell on the ruined palisade, either mystery or loneliness kissed my open eyes. It felt hugely convex, seeing and immediately forgetting.

580	Without Regret	260		\nNights, by the light of whatever would burn:  tallow, tinder and the silken rope of wick that burns slow, slow we wove the baskets from the long gold strands  of wheat that were another silk: worm soul spun the one, yellow seed in the dark soil, the other. The fields lay fallow, swollen with frost,  expectant winter. Mud clung to the edges of our gowns; we had hung back like shadows on the walls of trees and watched. In the little circles  that our tapers threw, murdered men rose red  in their clanging armor, muttered words that bled through the bars of iron masks: the lord who sold us to the glory fields, lied.

581	Hunting Manual	260		\nThe unicorn is an easy prey: its horn in the maiden’s lap is an obvious twist, a tamed figure—like the hawk that once roamed free, but sits now, fat and hooded,  squawking on the hunter’s wrist. It’s easy  to catch what no longer captures the mind, long since woven in, a faded tapestry on a crumbling wall made by the women who wore keys at their waists and in their sleep came hot dreams of wounded knights left bleeding in their care, who would wake the next morning  groaning from the leftover lance in the groin,  look up into the round blond face beaming down  at them thinking "mine," and say: "angel."  Such beasts are easy to catch; their dreams  betray them. But the hard prey is the one  that won’t come bidden. By these signs you will know it: when you lift your lure out of the water, the long plastic line will be missing its end: the lure and the hook  will be gone, and the line will swing free  in the air, so light it will be without bait or its cunning sharp curl of silver. Or when you pull your net from the stream, it will be eaten  as if by acid, its fine mesh sodden shreds. Or when you go at dawn to check your traps,  their great metal jaws will be wrenched open, the teeth blunt with rust as if they had lain for years in the rain. Or when the thunderstorm suddenly breaks  in the summer, next morning the computer’s memory will be blank. Look then for the blank card, the sprung trap,  the net’s dissolve, the unburdened  line that swings free in the air. There. By day, go empty-handed to the hunt  and come home the same way  in the dark. \n	'acid':213 'air':182,291 'angel':118 'bait':189 'beam':110 'beast':120 'betray':127 'bidden':140 'blank':269,274 'bleed':85 'blond':108 'blunt':239 'break':257 'came':78 'captur':50 'card':275 'care':88 'catch':46,124 'check':226 'come':139,303 'comput':264 'crumbl':62 'cun':192 'curl':194 'dark':310 'dawn':224 'day':294 'dissolv':282 'dream':80,126 'easi':7,44,122 'eaten':209 'empti':297 'empty-hand':296 'end':165 'face':109 'fade':58 'fat':33 'figur':22 'fine':215 'free':29,179,288 'go':222,295 'gone':173 'great':230 'groan':95 'groin':102 'hand':298 'hard':131 'hawk':25 'home':304 'hood':35 'hook':170 'horn':10 'hot':79 'hunt':1,301 'hunter':39 'jaw':232 'key':70 'knight':83 'know':146 'lain':246 'lanc':99 'lap':15 'left':84 'leftov':98 'lift':150 'light':184 'like':23 'line':160,176,285 'long':53,158 'longer':49 'look':103,270 'lure':152,167 'made':64 'maiden':13 'manual':2 'memori':266 'mesh':216 'metal':231 'mind':52 'mine':115 'miss':163 'morn':94,262 'net':202,280 'next':93,261 'obvious':18 'one':135 'open':236 'plastic':159 'prey':8,132 'pull':200 'rain':251 'roam':28 'round':107 'rust':241 'say':117 'sharp':193 'shred':218 'sign':143 'silver':196 'sinc':54 'sit':31 'sleep':77 'sodden':217 'sprung':277 'squawk':36 'stream':205 'sudden':256 'summer':260 'swing':178,287 'tame':21 'tapestri':59 'teeth':238 'think':114 'thunderstorm':255 'trap':228,278 'twist':19 'unburden':284 'unicorn':4 'waist':73 'wake':91 'wall':63 'water':156 'way':307 'without':188 'women':67 'won':137 'wore':69 'would':90 'wound':82 'woven':55 'wrench':235 'wrist':41 'year':248

583	Bailing Out-A Poem for the 1970s	260		\nThe landings had gone wrong; white silk,  like shrouds, covered the woods. The trees had trapped the flimsy fabric in their web—everywhere the harnessed bodies  hung—helpless, treading air like water.                   We thought to float down easily—a simple thing like coming home: feet first, a welcome from the waiting fields, a gentle fall in clover. We hadn’t counted on this wilderness, the gusts of wind that took us over; we were surprised  by the tenacity of branching wood,  its reach, and how impenetrable the place we left, and thought we knew,  could be.                Sometimes now, as we sway, unwilling  pendulums that mark the time,  we still can dream someone will come and cut us down.  There is nothing here but words, the calls  we try the dark with—hoping for a human  ear, response, a rescue party. But all we hear is other voices like our own, other bodies  tangled in the lines, the repetition of a cry from every tree: I can’t help you, help me.\n	'1970s':8 'air':38 'bail':1 'bodi':34,160 'branch':88 'call':134 'clover':65 'come':51,122 'could':103 'count':69 'cover':18 'cri':169 'cut':124 'dark':138 'dream':119 'ear':144 'easili':46 'everi':171 'everywher':31 'fabric':27 'fall':63 'feet':53 'field':60 'first':54 'flimsi':26 'float':44 'gentl':62 'gone':12 'gust':74 'hadn':67 'har':33 'hear':152 'help':176,178 'helpless':36 'home':52 'hope':140 'human':143 'hung':35 'impenetr':94 'knew':102 'land':10 'left':98 'like':16,39,50,156 'line':164 'mark':113 'noth':129 'out-a':2 'parti':148 'pendulum':111 'place':96 'poem':5 'reach':91 'repetit':166 'rescu':147 'respons':145 'shroud':17 'silk':15 'simpl':48 'someon':120 'sometim':105 'still':117 'surpris':83 'sway':109 'tangl':161 'tenac':86 'thing':49 'thought':42,100 'time':115 'took':78 'trap':24 'tread':37 'tree':22,172 'tri':136 'unwil':110 'us':79,125 'voic':155 'wait':59 'water':40 'web':30 'welcom':56 'white':14 'wilder':72 'wind':76 'wood':20,89 'word':132 'wrong':13
584	Bat Cave	260		\nThe cave looked much like any other  from a little distance but as we approached, came almost to its mouth, we saw its walls within  that slanted up into a dome were beating like a wild black lung— it was plastered and hung with  the pulsing bodies of bats, the organ  music of the body’s deep interior, alive, the sacred cave with its ten thousand gleaming eyes  near the clustered rocks where the sea beat with the leather  wings of its own dark waves. Below the bat-hung, throbbing walls,  an altar stood, glittering with guano,  a stucco sculpture like a Gaudi church, berserk Baroque, stone translated into flux—murk and mud and the floral  extravagance of wet sand dripped  from a giant hand, giving back blessing, excrement—return for the first fruits offered to the gods. We stayed outside, superior with fear, like tourists peering through a door, whose hanging  beads rattle in the air from one who disappeared into the dim interior; we thought of the caves of Marabar, of a writer who entered  and never quite emerged— the caves’ echoing black emptiness a tunnel in the English  soul where he is wandering still. So  the bat cave on the Bali coast, not far from Denpasar, holds us off, and beckons ... Standing there now, at the mouth  of the cave—this time we enter, feel  inside the flutter of those many hearts, the radiant heat of pumping  veins, the stretch of wing on bone  like a benediction, and the familiar  faces of this many-headed god,  benevolent as night is to the weary—the way at dark  the cave releases them all, how they must lift like the foam  on a wave breaking, how many  they are as they enter the starlit air, and scatter in wild wide arcs in search of fruit, the sweet bites  of mosquito ... while the great domes of our  own kind slide open, the eye  that watches, tracks the skies, and the huge doors roll slowly back  on the hangars, the planes  push out their noses of steel,  their wings a bright alloy of aluminum and death, they roar  down the runways, tear into the night, their heavy bodies fueled  from sucking at the hidden veins of earth; they leave a trail of fire  behind them as they scar  the air, filling the dreams  of children, sleeping—anywhere,  Chicago, Baghdad—with blood, as the bombs drop, as the world splits open, as the mothers  reach for their own in the night of the falling  sky, madness in method, nature gone  into reverse ... here, nearly unperturbed, the bats from the sacred cave  fill the night with their calls,  high-pitched, tuned to the solid world  as eyes to the spectrum of light, gnats  to the glow of a lamp—the bats  circle, the clouds wheel, the earth turns pulling the dome of stars among the spinning trees, blurring  the sweet globes of fruit, shaped  exactly to desire—dizzy, we swing  back to the cave on our stiff dark  wings, the sweet juice of papaya  drying on our jaws, home to the cave, to attach ourselves  back to the pulsing dome, until, hanging there, sated and sleepy, we can see what was once our world  upside down as it is and wonder whose altars those are, white, encrusted with shit. \n	'air':160,300,393 'aliv':61 'alloy':355 'almost':19 'altar':96,555 'aluminum':357 'among':486 'anywher':400 'approach':17 'arc':306 'attach':526 'back':130,339,503,528 'baghdad':402 'bali':207 'baroqu':109 'bat':1,51,91,203,439,473 'bat-hung':90 'bead':156 'beat':35,78 'beckon':217 'behind':387 'benedict':253 'benevol':264 'berserk':108 'bite':313 'black':39,188 'bless':131 'blood':404 'blur':490 'bodi':49,57,371 'bomb':407 'bone':250 'break':290 'bright':354 'call':449 'came':18 'cave':2,4,64,173,186,204,226,276,443,506,524 'chicago':401 'children':398 'church':107 'circl':474 'cloud':476 'cluster':73 'coast':208 'dark':86,274,510 'death':359 'deep':59 'denpasar':212 'desir':499 'dim':167 'disappear':164 'distanc':13 'dizzi':500 'dome':33,319,483,532 'door':153,336 'dream':396 'dri':517 'drip':124 'drop':408 'earth':380,479 'echo':187 'emerg':184 'empti':189 'encrust':559 'english':194 'enter':180,230,297 'exact':497 'excrement':132 'extravag':120 'eye':70,327,459 'face':257 'fall':426 'familiar':256 'far':210 'fear':147 'feel':231 'fill':394,444 'fire':386 'first':136 'floral':119 'flutter':234 'flux':113 'foam':286 'fruit':137,310,495 'fuel':372 'gaudi':106 'giant':127 'give':129 'gleam':69 'glitter':98 'globe':493 'glow':468 'gnat':465 'god':141,263 'gone':432 'great':318 'guano':100 'hand':128 'hang':155,534 'hangar':342 'head':262 'heart':238 'heat':241 'heavi':370 'hidden':377 'high':451 'high-pitch':450 'hold':213 'home':521 'huge':335 'hung':45,92 'insid':232 'interior':60,168 'jaw':520 'juic':514 'kind':323 'lamp':471 'leather':81 'leav':382 'lift':283 'light':464 'like':7,36,104,148,251,284 'littl':12 'look':5 'lung':40 'mad':428 'mani':237,261,292 'many-head':260 'marabar':175 'method':430 'mosquito':315 'mother':416 'mouth':22,223 'much':6 'mud':116 'murk':114 'music':54 'must':282 'natur':431 'near':71,436 'never':182 'night':266,368,423,446 'nose':348 'offer':138 'one':162 'open':325,413 'organ':53 'outsid':144 'papaya':516 'peer':150 'pitch':452 'plane':344 'plaster':43 'pull':481 'puls':48,531 'pump':243 'push':345 'quit':183 'radiant':240 'rattl':157 'reach':417 'releas':277 'return':133 'revers':434 'roar':361 'rock':74 'roll':337 'runway':364 'sacr':63,442 'sand':123 'sate':536 'saw':24 'scar':391 'scatter':302 'sculptur':103 'sea':77 'search':308 'see':541 'shape':496 'shit':561 'sky':332,427 'slant':29 'sleep':399 'sleepi':538 'slide':324 'slowli':338 'solid':456 'soul':195 'spectrum':462 'spin':488 'split':412 'stand':218 'star':485 'starlit':299 'stay':143 'steel':350 'stiff':509 'still':200 'stone':110 'stood':97 'stretch':246 'stucco':102 'suck':374 'superior':145 'sweet':312,492,513 'swing':502 'tear':365 'ten':67 'thought':170 'thousand':68 'throb':93 'time':228 'tourist':149 'track':330 'trail':384 'translat':111 'tree':489 'tune':453 'tunnel':191 'turn':480 'unperturb':437 'upsid':547 'us':214 'vein':244,378 'wall':26,94 'wander':199 'watch':329 'wave':87,289 'way':272 'weari':270 'wet':122 'wheel':477 'white':558 'whose':154,554 'wide':305 'wild':38,304 'wing':82,248,352,511 'within':27 'wonder':553 'world':411,457,546 'writer':178
585	High Noon at Los Alamos	260		\nTo turn a stone with its white squirming underneath, to pry the disc from the sun’s eclipse—white heat coiling in the blinded eye: to these malign   necessities we come from the dim time of dinosaurs who crawled like breathing lava from the earth’s cracked crust, and swung   their tiny heads above the lumbering tons   of flesh, brains no bigger than a fist clenched to resist the white flash in the sky the day the sun-flares pared them down to relics for museums,   turned glaciers back, seared Sinai’s meadows black—the ferns withered, the swamps   were melted down to molten mud, the cells   uncoupled, recombined, and madly multiplied, huge trees toppled to the ground,   the slow life there abandoned hope, a caterpillar stiffened in the grass. Two apes, caught in the act of coupling,   made a mutant child who woke to sunlight wondering, his mother   torn by the huge new head that forced the narrow birth canal. As if compelled to repetition   and to unearth again white fire at the heart of matter—fire we sought and fire we spoke, our thoughts, however elegant, were fire from first to last—like sentries set to watch   at Argos for the signal fire passed peak to peak from Troy to Nagasaki, triumphant echo of the burning   city walls and prologue to the murders   yet to come—we scan the sky for that bright flash, our eyes stared white from watching   for the signal fire that ends the epic—a cursed line with its caesura, a pause to signal peace, or a rehearsal for the silence.\n	'abandon':129 'act':142 'alamo':5 'ape':138 'argo':207 'back':95 'bigger':67 'birth':166 'black':100 'blind':29 'brain':65 'breath':46 'bright':241 'burn':224 'caesura':262 'canal':167 'caterpillar':132 'caught':139 'cell':113 'child':148 'citi':225 'clench':71 'coil':26 'come':36,234 'compel':170 'coupl':144 'crack':52 'crawl':44 'crust':53 'curs':258 'day':81 'dim':39 'dinosaur':42 'disc':18 'earth':50 'echo':221 'eclips':23 'eleg':194 'end':254 'epic':256 'eye':30,244 'fern':102 'fire':178,184,188,196,211,252 'first':198 'fist':70 'flare':85 'flash':76,242 'flesh':64 'forc':163 'glacier':94 'grass':136 'ground':124 'head':58,161 'heart':181 'heat':25 'high':1 'hope':130 'howev':193 'huge':119,159 'last':200 'lava':47 'life':127 'like':45,201 'line':259 'los':4 'lumber':61 'mad':117 'made':145 'malign':33 'matter':183 'meadow':99 'melt':107 'molten':110 'mother':155 'mud':111 'multipli':118 'murder':231 'museum':92 'mutant':147 'nagasaki':219 'narrow':165 'necess':34 'new':160 'noon':2 'pare':86 'pass':212 'paus':264 'peac':267 'peak':213,215 'pri':16 'prologu':228 'recombin':115 'rehears':270 'relic':90 'repetit':172 'resist':73 'scan':236 'sear':96 'sentri':202 'set':203 'signal':210,251,266 'silenc':273 'sinai':97 'sky':79,238 'slow':126 'sought':186 'spoke':190 'squirm':13 'stare':245 'stiffen':133 'stone':9 'sun':21,84 'sun-flar':83 'sunlight':152 'swamp':105 'swung':55 'thought':192 'time':40 'tini':57 'ton':62 'toppl':121 'torn':156 'tree':120 'triumphant':220 'troy':217 'turn':7,93 'two':137 'uncoupl':114 'underneath':14 'unearth':175 'wall':226 'watch':205,248 'white':12,24,75,177,246 'wither':103 'woke':150 'wonder':153 'yet':232

Dull remembrance taught  Remembers on unceasingly; unsought  The old delight is with us but to find  That all recurring joy is pain refined,  Become a habit, and we struggle, caught.  You lie upon my heart as on a nest,  Folded in peace, for you can never know  How crushed I am with having you at rest  Heavy upon my life. I love you so You bind my freedom from its rightful quest.

587	Nuit Blanche	261		\nI want no horns to rouse me up to-night,   And trumpets make too clamorous a ring   To fit my mood, it is so weary white   I have no wish for doing any thing. A music coaxed from humming strings would please;   Not plucked, but drawn in creeping cadences   Across a sunset wall where some Marquise Picks a pale rose amid strange silences. Ghostly and vaporous her gown sweeps by   The twilight dusking wall, I hear her feet   Delaying on the gravel, and a sigh, Briefly permitted, touches the air like sleet And it is dark, I hear her feet no more.   A red moon leers beyond the lily-tank.   A drunken moon ogling a sycamore,   Running long fingers down its shining flank. A lurching moon, as nimble as a clown, Cuddling the flowers and trees which burn like glass. Red, kissing lips, I feel you on my gown— Kiss me, red lips, and then pass—pass. Music, you are pitiless to-night. And I so old, so cold, so languorously white. \n	'across':53 'air':93 'amid':64 'beyond':110 'blanch':2 'briefli':89 'burn':142 'cadenc':52 'clamor':18 'clown':135 'coax':40 'cold':174 'creep':51 'cuddl':136 'dark':99 'delay':82 'drawn':49 'drunken':116 'dusk':76 'feel':149 'feet':81,103 'finger':123 'fit':22 'flank':127 'flower':138 'ghost':67 'glass':144 'gown':71,153 'gravel':85 'hear':79,101 'horn':6 'hum':42 'kiss':146,154 'languor':176 'leer':109 'like':94,143 'lili':113 'lily-tank':112 'lip':147,157 'long':122 'lurch':129 'make':16 'marquis':59 'mood':24 'moon':108,117,130 'music':39,162 'night':13,168 'nimbl':132 'nuit':1 'ogl':118 'old':172 'pale':62 'pass':160,161 'permit':90 'pick':60 'pitiless':165 'pleas':45 'pluck':47 'red':107,145,156 'ring':20 'rose':63 'rous':8 'run':121 'shine':126 'sigh':88 'silenc':66 'sleet':95 'strang':65 'string':43 'sunset':55 'sweep':72 'sycamor':120 'tank':114 'thing':37 'to-night':11,166 'touch':91 'tree':140 'trumpet':15 'twilight':75 'vapor':69 'wall':56,77 'want':4 'weari':28 'white':29,177 'wish':33 'would':44

589	In a Garden	261		\nGushing from the mouths of stone men To spread at ease under the sky In granite-lipped basins, Where iris dabble their feet And rustle to a passing wind, The water fills the garden with its rushing, In the midst of the quiet of close-clipped lawns. Damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone,   Where trickle and plash the fountains,   Marble fountains, yellowed with much water. Splashing down moss-tarnished steps   It falls, the water; And the air is throbbing with it; With its gurgling and running; With its leaping, and deep, cool murmur. And I wished for night and you. I wanted to see you in the swimming-pool,   White and shining in the silver-flecked water. While the moon rode over the garden,   High in the arch of night, And the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness. Night and the water, and you in your whiteness, bathing! \n	'air':85 'arch':138 'basin':22 'bath':160 'clip':51 'close':50 'close-clip':49 'cool':100 'dabbl':25 'damp':53 'deep':99 'eas':14 'fall':80 'feet':27 'fern':56 'fill':36 'fleck':126 'fountain':66,68 'garden':3,38,134 'granit':20 'granite-lip':19 'gurgl':92 'gush':4 'heavi':148 'high':135 'iri':24 'lawn':52 'leap':97 'lilac':146 'lip':21 'marbl':67 'men':10 'midst':44 'moon':130 'moss':76 'moss-tarnish':75 'mouth':7 'much':71 'murmur':101 'night':106,140,151 'pass':32 'plash':64 'pool':118 'quiet':47 'rode':131 'run':94 'rush':41 'rustl':29 'scent':143 'see':112 'shine':121 'silver':125 'silver-fleck':124 'sky':17 'smell':54 'splash':73 'spread':12 'step':78 'still':150 'stone':9,60 'swim':117 'swimming-pool':116 'tarnish':77 'throb':87 'trickl':62 'tunnel':58 'want':110 'water':35,72,82,127,154 'white':119,159 'wind':33 'wish':104 'yellow':69

591	The Blue Scarf	261		\nPale, with the blue of high zeniths, shimmered over with silver, brocaded In smooth, running patterns, a soft stuff, with dark knotted fringes, it lies there, Warm from a woman’s soft shoulders, and my fingers close on it, caressing. Where is she, the woman who wore it? The scent of her lingers and drugs me. A languor, fire-shotted, runs through me, and I crush the scarf down on my face, And gulp in the warmth and the blueness, and my eyes swim in cool-tinted heavens. Around me are columns of marble, and a diapered, sun-flickered pavement. Rose-leaves blow and patter against it. Below the stone steps a lute tinkles. A jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor. A big-bellied Frog hops through the sunlight, and plops in the gold-bubbled water of a basin, Sunk in the black and white marble. The west wind has lifted a scarf On the seat close beside me; the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour. She draws it more closely about her, and it ripples beneath her slight stirring. Her kisses are sharp buds of fire; and I burn back against her, a jewel Hard and white, a stalked, flaming flower; till I break to a handful of cinders, And open my eyes to the scarf, shining blue in the afternoon sunshine.

592	The Elements of San Joaquin	262		\nField The wind sprays pale dirt into my mouth \rThe small, almost invisible scars \rOn my hands.\rThe pores in my throat and elbows\rHave taken in a seed of dirt of their own.\rAfter a day in the grape fields near Rolinda \rA fine silt, washed by sweat, \rHas settled into the lines \rOn my wrists and palms.\rAlready I am becoming the valley, \rA soil that sprouts nothing. \rFor any of us.\rWind A dry wind over the valley\rPeeled mountains, grain by grain, \rTo small slopes, loose dirt\rWhere red ants tunnel.\rThe wind strokes\rThe skulls and spines of cattle \rTo white dust, to nothing,\rCovers the spiked tracks of beetles, \rOf tumbleweed, of sparrows \rThat pecked the ground for insects.\rEvenings, when I am in the yard weeding, \rThe wind picks up the breath of my armpits\rLike dust, swirls it \rMiles away\rAnd drops it\rOn the ear of a rabid dog, \rAnd I take on another life.\rWind When you got up this morning the sun \rBlazed an hour in the sky,\rA lizard hid\rUnder the curled leaves of manzanita \rAnd winked its dark lids.\rLater, the sky grayed,\rAnd the cold wind you breathed\rWas moving under your skin and already far \rFrom the small hives of your lungs.\rStars At dusk the first stars appear.\rNot one eager finger points toward them. \rA little later the stars spread with the night \rAnd an orange moon rises\rTo lead them, like a shepherd, toward dawn.\rSun In June the sun is a bonnet of light \rComing up,\rLittle by little,\rFrom behind a skyline of pine.\rThe pastures sway with fiddle-neck, \rTassels of foxtail.\rAt Piedra\rA couple fish on the river’s edge, \rTheir shadows deep against the water. \rAbove, in the stubbled slopes,\rCows climb down\rAs the heat rises\rIn a mist of blond locusts,\rReturning to the valley.\rRain When autumn rains flatten sycamore leaves, \rThe tiny volcanos of dirt\rAnts raised around their holes,\rI should be out of work.\rMy silverware and stack of plates will go unused \rLike the old, my two good slacks\rWill smother under a growth of lint\rAnd smell of the old dust\rThat rises\rWhen the closet door opens or closes.\rThe skin of my belly will tighten like a belt \rAnd there will be no reason for pockets.\rHarvest East of the sun’s slant, in the vineyard that never failed, \rA wind crossed my face, moving the dust \rAnd a portion of my voice a step closer to a new year.\rThe sky went black in the ninth hour of rolling trays, \rAnd in the distance ropes of rain dropped to pull me \rFrom the thick harvest that was not mine.\rFog If you go to your window\rYou will notice a fog drifting in.\rThe sun is no stronger than a flashlight. \rNot all the sweaters \rHung in closets all summer\rCould soak up this mist. The fog:\rA mouth nibbling everything to its origin, \rPomegranate trees, stolen bicycles,\rThe string of lights at a used-car lot, \rA Pontiac with scorched valves.\rIn Fresno the fog is passing\rThe young thief prying a window screen, \rGraying my hair that falls\rAnd goes unfound, my fingerprints \rSlowly growing a fur of dust\rOne hundred years from now\rThere should be no reason to believe \rI lived.\rDaybreak In this moment when the light starts up \rIn the east and rubs \rThe horizon until it catches fire,\rWe enter the fields to hoe,\rRow after row, among the small flags of onion, \rWaving off the dragonflies \rThat ladder the air.\rAnd tears the onions raise\rDo not begin in your eyes but in ours, \rIn the salt blown\rFrom one blister into another;\rThey begin in knowing\rYou will never waken to bear\rThe hour timed to a heart beat,\rThe wind pressing us closer to the ground.\rWhen the season ends,\rAnd the onions are unplugged from their sleep, \rWe won’t forget what you failed to see, \rAnd nothing will heal\rUnder the rain’s broken fingers.\n	'air':621 'almost':17 'alreadi':65,215 'among':608 'anoth':168,644 'ant':99,341 'appear':230 'armpit':147 'around':343 'autumn':331 'away':153 'bear':654 'beat':661 'becom':68 'beetl':120 'begin':629,646 'behind':276 'believ':576 'belli':394 'belt':399 'bicycl':520 'black':445 'blaze':179 'blister':642 'blond':323 'blown':639 'bonnet':267 'breath':144,208 'broken':699 'car':529 'catch':597 'cattl':109 'climb':313 'close':389 'closer':437,666 'closet':385,500 'cold':205 'come':270 'could':503 'coupl':294 'cover':115 'cow':312 'cross':423 'curl':190 'dark':197 'dawn':259 'day':42 'daybreak':579 'deep':303 'dirt':11,36,96,340 'distanc':456 'dog':163 'door':386 'dragonfli':617 'dri':82 'drift':484 'drop':155,460 'dusk':226 'dust':112,149,380,428,564 'eager':233 'ear':159 'east':409,590 'edg':300 'elbow':29 'element':2 'end':673 'enter':600 'even':131 'everyth':513 'eye':632 'face':425 'fail':420,688 'fall':553 'far':216 'fiddl':286 'fiddle-neck':285 'field':6,46,602 'fine':50 'finger':234,700 'fingerprint':558 'fire':598 'first':228 'fish':295 'flag':611 'flashlight':493 'flatten':333 'fog':472,483,509,539 'forget':685 'foxtail':290 'fresno':537 'fur':562 'go':359,475 'goe':555 'good':366 'got':173 'grain':89,91 'grape':45 'gray':202,549 'ground':128,669 'grow':560 'growth':372 'hair':551 'hand':22 'harvest':408,467 'heal':694 'heart':660 'heat':317 'hid':187 'hive':220 'hoe':604 'hole':345 'horizon':594 'hour':181,449,656 'hundr':566 'hung':498 'insect':130 'invis':18 'joaquin':5 'june':262 'know':648 'ladder':619 'later':199,240 'lead':253 'leav':191,335 'lid':198 'life':169 'light':269,524,585 'like':148,255,361,397 'line':59 'lint':374 'littl':239,272,274 'live':578 'lizard':186 'locust':324 'loos':95 'lot':530 'lung':223 'manzanita':193 'mile':152 'mine':471 'mist':321,507 'moment':582 'moon':250 'morn':176 'mountain':88 'mouth':14,511 'move':210,426 'near':47 'neck':287 'never':419,651 'new':440 'nibbl':512 'night':246 'ninth':448 'noth':75,114,692 'notic':481 'old':363,379 'one':232,565,641 'onion':613,625,676 'open':387 'orang':249 'origin':516 'pale':10 'palm':64 'pass':541 'pastur':282 'peck':126 'peel':87 'pick':141 'piedra':292 'pine':280 'plate':357 'pocket':407 'point':235 'pomegran':517 'pontiac':532 'pore':24 'portion':431 'press':664 'pri':545 'pull':462 'rabid':162 'rain':329,332,459,697 'rais':342,626 'reason':405,574 'red':98 'return':325 'rise':251,318,382 'river':298 'rolinda':48 'roll':451 'rope':457 'row':605,607 'rub':592 'salt':638 'san':4 'scar':19 'scorch':534 'screen':548 'season':672 'see':690 'seed':34 'settl':56 'shadow':302 'shepherd':257 'silt':51 'silverwar':353 'skin':213,391 'skull':105 'sky':184,201,443 'skylin':278 'slack':367 'slant':414 'sleep':681 'slope':94,311 'slowli':559 'small':16,93,219,610 'smell':376 'smother':369 'soak':504 'soil':72 'sparrow':124 'spike':117 'spine':107 'spray':9 'spread':243 'sprout':74 'stack':355 'star':224,229,242 'start':586 'step':436 'stolen':519 'string':522 'stroke':103 'stronger':490 'stubbl':310 'summer':502 'sun':178,260,264,412,487 'sway':283 'sweat':54 'sweater':497 'swirl':150 'sycamor':334 'take':166 'taken':31 'tassel':288 'tear':623 'thick':466 'thief':544 'throat':27 'tighten':396 'time':657 'tini':337 'toward':236,258 'track':118 'tray':452 'tree':518 'tumblewe':122 'tunnel':100 'two':365 'unfound':556 'unplug':678 'unus':360 'us':79,665 'use':528 'used-car':527 'valley':70,86,328 'valv':535 'vineyard':417 'voic':434 'volcano':338 'waken':652 'wash':52 'water':306 'wave':614 'weed':138 'went':444 'white':111 'wind':8,80,83,102,140,170,206,422,663 'window':478,547 'wink':195 'won':683 'work':351 'wrist':62 'yard':137 'year':441,567 'young':543
593	Patterns	261		\nI walk down the garden paths, And all the daffodils Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.  I walk down the patterned garden paths  In my stiff, brocaded gown. With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,  I too am a rare Pattern. As I wander down The garden paths. My dress is richly figured,  And the train Makes a pink and silver stain  On the gravel, and the thrift  Of the borders. Just a plate of current fashion, Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes. Not a softness anywhere about me,  Only whale-bone and brocade.  And I sink on a seat in the shade  Of a lime tree. For my passion  Wars against the stiff brocade.  The daffodils and squills Flutter in the breeze As they please. And I weep; For the lime tree is in blossom And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom. And the splashing of waterdrops  In the marble fountain Comes down the garden paths.  The dripping never stops.  Underneath my stiffened gown Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin, A basin in the midst of hedges grown So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding, But she guesses he is near, And the sliding of the water Seems the stroking of a dear Hand upon her. What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown! I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.  All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground. I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,  And he would stumble after, Bewildered by my laughter. I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles on his shoes. I would choose To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths, A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,  Till he caught me in the shade, And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me, Aching, melting, unafraid. With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,  And the plopping of the waterdrops, All about us in the open afternoon I am very like to swoon With the weight of this brocade, For the sun sifts through the shade. Underneath the fallen blossom In my bosom, Is a letter I have hid. It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.  “Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell  Died in action Thursday sen’night.” As I read it in the white, morning sunlight, The letters squirmed like snakes. “Any answer, Madam,” said my footman. “No,” l told him. “See that the messenger takes some refreshment. No, no answer.” And I walked into the garden, Up and down the patterned paths, In my stiff, correct brocade. The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,  Each one. I stood upright too, Held rigid to the pattern By the stiffness of my gown.  Up and down I walked,  Up and down. In a month he would have been my husband.  In a month, here, underneath this lime,  We would have broke the pattern; He for me, and I for him, He as Colonel, I as Lady, On this shady seat. He had a whim That sunlight carried blessing. And I answered, “It shall be as you have said.”  Now he is dead. In Summer and in Winter I shall walk Up and down The patterned garden paths  In my stiff, brocaded gown.  The squills and daffodils Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.  I shall go Up and down, In my gown. Gorgeously arrayed, Boned and stayed. And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace  By each button, hook, and lace. For the man who should loose me is dead, Fighting with the Duke in Flanders, In a pattern called a war. Christ!

594	Thompson’s Lunch Room—Grand Central Station	261		\nSTUDY IN WHITES Wax-white— Floor, ceiling, walls.   Ivory shadows Over the pavement   Polished to cream surfaces By constant sweeping. The big room is coloured like the petals Of a great magnolia,   And has a patina   Of flower bloom Which makes it shine dimly Under the electric lamps. Chairs are ranged in rows Like sepia seeds   Waiting fulfilment. The chalk-white spot of a cook’s cap Moves unglossily against the vaguely bright wall— Dull chalk-white striking the retina like a blow Thru the wavering uncertainty of steam. Vitreous-white of glasses with green reflections, Ice-green carboys, shifting—greener, bluer—with the jar of moving water. Jagged green-white bowls of pressed glass Rearing snow-peaks of chipped sugar Above the lighthouse-shaped castors Of grey pepper and grey-white salt. Grey-white placards: “Oyster Stew, Cornbeef Hash, Frankfurters”: Marble slabs veined with words in meandering lines.   Dropping on the white counter like horn notes Through a web of violins, The flat yellow lights of oranges, The cube-red splashes of apples, In high plated épergnes. The electric clock jerks every half-minute: “Coming!—Past!” “Three beef-steaks and a chicken-pie,” Bawled through a slide while the clock jerks heavily. A man carries a china mug of coffee to a distant chair. Two rice puddings and a salmon salad Are pushed over the counter; The unfulfilled chairs open to receive them. A spoon falls upon the floor with the impact of metal striking stone, And the sound throws across the room Sharp, invisible zigzags Of silver.\n	'across':273 'appl':192 'bawl':216 'beef':209 'beef-steak':208 'big':30 'bloom':47 'blow':93 'bluer':114 'bowl':125 'bright':82 'cap':76 'carboy':111 'carri':227 'castor':141 'ceil':15 'central':6 'chair':57,236,251 'chalk':69,86 'chalk-whit':68,85 'chicken':214 'chicken-pi':213 'china':229 'chip':134 'clock':199,222 'coffe':232 'colour':33 'come':205 'constant':27 'cook':74 'cornbeef':156 'counter':171,248 'cream':24 'cube':188 'cube-r':187 'dim':52 'distant':235 'drop':167 'dull':84 'electr':55,198 'everi':201 'fall':258 'flat':181 'floor':14,261 'flower':46 'frankfurt':158 'fulfil':66 'glass':104,128 'grand':5 'great':39 'green':106,110,123 'green-whit':122 'greener':113 'grey':143,147,151 'grey-whit':146,150 'half':203 'half-minut':202 'hash':157 'heavili':224 'high':194 'horn':173 'ice':109 'ice-green':108 'impact':264 'invis':277 'ivori':17 'jag':121 'jar':117 'jerk':200,223 'lamp':56 'light':183 'lighthous':139 'lighthouse-shap':138 'like':34,62,91,172 'line':166 'lunch':3 'magnolia':40 'make':49 'man':226 'marbl':159 'meander':165 'metal':266 'minut':204 'move':77,119 'mug':230 'note':174 'open':252 'orang':185 'oyster':154 'past':206 'patina':44 'pavement':21 'peak':132 'pepper':144 'petal':36 'pie':215 'placard':153 'plate':195 'polish':22 'press':127 'pud':239 'push':245 'rang':59 'rear':129 'receiv':254 'red':189 'reflect':107 'retina':90 'rice':238 'room':4,31,275 'row':61 'salad':243 'salmon':242 'salt':149 'seed':64 'sepia':63 'shadow':18 'shape':140 'sharp':276 'shift':112 'shine':51 'silver':280 'slab':160 'slide':219 'snow':131 'snow-peak':130 'sound':271 'splash':190 'spoon':257 'spot':71 'station':7 'steak':210 'steam':99 'stew':155 'stone':268 'strike':88,267 'studi':8 'sugar':135 'surfac':25 'sweep':28 'thompson':1 'three':207 'throw':272 'thru':94 'two':237 'uncertainti':97 'unfulfil':250 'unglossili':78 'upon':259 'vagu':81 'vein':161 'violin':179 'vitreous':101 'vitreous-whit':100 'wait':65 'wall':16,83 'water':120 'waver':96 'wax':12 'wax-whit':11 'web':177 'white':10,13,70,87,102,124,148,152,170 'word':163 'yellow':182 'zigzag':278 'épergn':196
595	Penumbra	261		\nAs I sit here in the quiet Summer night, Suddenly, from the distant road, there comes The grind and rush of an electric car. And, from still farther off, An engine puffs sharply, Followed by the drawn-out shunting scrape of a freight train.  These are the sounds that men make In the long business of living. They will always make such sounds, Years after I am dead and cannot hear them. Sitting here in the Summer night, I think of my death. What will it be like for you then? You will see my chair With its bright chintz covering Standing in the afternoon sunshine, As now. You will see my narrow table At which I have written so many hours. My dogs will push their noses into your hand,  And ask—ask— Clinging to you with puzzled eyes. The old house will still be here, The old house which has known me since the beginning.  The walls which have watched me while I played:  Soldiers, marbles, paper-dolls, Which have protected me and my books. The front-door will gaze down among the old trees  Where, as a child, I hunted ghosts and Indians;  It will look out on the wide gravel sweep Where I rolled my hoop, And at the rhododendron bushes Where I caught black-spotted butterflies. The old house will guard you, As I have done. Its walls and rooms will hold you, And I shall whisper my thoughts and fancies  As always, From the pages of my books. You will sit here, some quiet Summer night,  Listening to the puffing trains, But you will not be lonely, For these things are a part of me. And my love will go on speaking to you Through the chairs, and the tables, and the pictures,  As it does now through my voice, And the quick, necessary touch of my hand. \n	'afternoon':107 'alway':62,253 'among':188 'ask':135,136 'begin':159 'black':224 'black-spot':223 'book':180,259 'bright':101 'bush':219 'busi':57 'butterfli':226 'cannot':72 'car':25 'caught':222 'chair':98,298 'child':195 'chintz':102 'cling':137 'come':17 'cover':103 'dead':70 'death':85 'distant':14 'dog':126 'doll':173 'done':236 'door':184 'drawn':39 'drawn-out':38 'electr':24 'engin':32 'eye':142 'fanci':251 'farther':29 'follow':35 'freight':45 'front':183 'front-door':182 'gaze':186 'ghost':198 'go':291 'gravel':208 'grind':19 'guard':231 'hand':133,319 'hear':73 'hold':242 'hoop':214 'hour':124 'hous':145,152,229 'hunt':197 'indian':200 'known':155 'like':90 'listen':268 'live':59 'lone':278 'long':56 'look':203 'love':289 'make':53,63 'mani':123 'marbl':170 'men':52 'narrow':115 'necessari':315 'night':10,80,267 'nose':130 'old':144,151,190,228 'page':256 'paper':172 'paper-dol':171 'part':284 'penumbra':1 'pictur':304 'play':168 'protect':176 'puf':271 'puff':33 'push':128 'puzzl':141 'quick':314 'quiet':8,265 'rhododendron':218 'road':15 'roll':212 'room':240 'rush':21 'scrape':42 'see':96,113 'shall':246 'sharpli':34 'shunt':41 'sinc':157 'sit':4,75,262 'soldier':169 'sound':50,65 'speak':293 'spot':225 'stand':104 'still':28,147 'sudden':11 'summer':9,79,266 'sunshin':108 'sweep':209 'tabl':116,301 'thing':281 'think':82 'thought':249 'touch':316 'train':46,272 'tree':191 'voic':311 'wall':161,238 'watch':164 'whisper':247 'wide':207 'written':121 'year':66
596	September, 1918	261		\nThis afternoon was the colour of water falling through sunlight; The trees glittered with the tumbling of leaves; The sidewalks shone like alleys of dropped maple leaves, And the houses ran along them laughing out of square, open windows. Under a tree in the park, Two little boys, lying flat on their faces, Were carefully gathering red berries To put in a pasteboard box. Some day there will be no war, Then I shall take out this afternoon And turn it in my fingers, And remark the sweet taste of it upon my palate, And note the crisp variety of its flights of leaves. To-day I can only gather it And put it into my lunch-box, For I have time for nothing But the endeavour to balance myself Upon a broken world.\n	'1918':2 'afternoon':4,80 'alley':25 'along':34 'balanc':133 'berri':60 'box':66,122 'boy':50 'broken':137 'care':57 'colour':7 'crisp':100 'day':68,109 'drop':27 'endeavour':131 'face':55 'fall':10 'finger':86 'flat':52 'flight':104 'gather':58,113 'glitter':15 'hous':32 'laugh':36 'leav':20,29,106 'lie':51 'like':24 'littl':49 'lunch':121 'lunch-box':120 'mapl':28 'note':98 'noth':128 'open':40 'palat':96 'park':47 'pasteboard':65 'put':62,116 'ran':33 'red':59 'remark':88 'septemb':1 'shall':76 'shone':23 'sidewalk':22 'squar':39 'sunlight':12 'sweet':90 'take':77 'tast':91 'time':126 'to-day':107 'tree':14,44 'tumbl':18 'turn':82 'two':48 'upon':94,135 'varieti':101 'war':73 'water':9 'window':41 'world':138

598	Lilacs	261		\nLilacs, False blue, White, Purple, Color of lilac, Your great puffs of flowers Are everywhere in this my New England.  Among your heart-shaped leaves Orange orioles hop like music-box birds and sing  Their little weak soft songs; In the crooks of your branches The bright eyes of song sparrows sitting on spotted eggs  Peer restlessly through the light and shadow  Of all Springs. Lilacs in dooryards Holding quiet conversations with an early moon;  Lilacs watching a deserted house Settling sideways into the grass of an old road; Lilacs, wind-beaten, staggering under a lopsided shock of bloom Above a cellar dug into a hill. You are everywhere. You were everywhere. You tapped the window when the preacher preached his sermon, And ran along the road beside the boy going to school. You stood by the pasture-bars to give the cows good milking,  You persuaded the housewife that her dishpan was of silver.  And her husband an image of pure gold.  You flaunted the fragrance of your blossoms  Through the wide doors of Custom Houses— You, and sandal-wood, and tea, Charging the noses of quill-driving clerks  When a ship was in from China. You called to them: “Goose-quill men, goose-quill men,  May is a month for flitting.” Until they writhed on their high stools And wrote poetry on their letter-sheets behind the propped-up ledgers. Paradoxical New England clerks, Writing inventories in ledgers, reading the “Song of Solomon” at night, So many verses before bed-time, Because it was the Bible. The dead fed you Amid the slant stones of graveyards. Pale ghosts who planted you Came in the nighttime And let their thin hair blow through your clustered stems.  You are of the green sea, And of the stone hills which reach a long distance. You are of elm-shaded streets with little shops where they sell kites and marbles, You are of great parks where every one walks and nobody is at home. You cover the blind sides of greenhouses And lean over the top to say a hurry-word through the glass  To your friends, the grapes, inside. Lilacs, False blue, White, Purple, Color of lilac, You have forgotten your Eastern origin,  The veiled women with eyes like panthers, The swollen, aggressive turbans of jeweled pashas. Now you are a very decent flower,  A reticent flower, A curiously clear-cut, candid flower,  Standing beside clean doorways, Friendly to a house-cat and a pair of spectacles,  Making poetry out of a bit of moonlight  And a hundred or two sharp blossoms. Maine knows you, Has for years and years; New Hampshire knows you, And Massachusetts And Vermont. Cape Cod starts you along the beaches to Rhode Island;  Connecticut takes you from a river to the sea.  You are brighter than apples, Sweeter than tulips, You are the great flood of our souls Bursting above the leaf-shapes of our hearts,  You are the smell of all Summers, The love of wives and children, The recollection of gardens of little children,  You are State Houses and Charters And the familiar treading of the foot to and fro on a road it knows. May is lilac here in New England, May is a thrush singing “Sun up!” on a tip-top ash tree,  May is white clouds behind pine-trees  Puffed out and marching upon a blue sky.  May is a green as no other, May is much sun through small leaves,  May is soft earth, And apple-blossoms, And windows open to a South Wind.  May is full light wind of lilac From Canada to Narragansett Bay. Lilacs, False blue, White, Purple, Color of lilac. Heart-leaves of lilac all over New England,  Roots of lilac under all the soil of New England,  Lilac in me because I am New England, Because my roots are in it, Because my leaves are of it, Because my flowers are for it,  Because it is my country And I speak to it of itself And sing of it with my own voice  Since certainly it is mine.\n	'aggress':396 'along':129,468 'amid':275 'among':22 'appl':487,606 'apple-blossom':605 'ash':568 'bar':144 'bay':626 'beach':470 'beaten':96 'bed':264 'bed-tim':263 'behind':238,574 'besid':132,419 'bibl':270 'bird':35 'bit':438 'blind':349 'bloom':103 'blossom':175,447,607 'blow':295 'blue':4,375,584,629 'box':34 'boy':134 'branch':48 'bright':50 'brighter':485 'burst':499 'call':206 'came':286 'canada':623 'candid':416 'cape':464 'cat':427 'cellar':106 'certain':701 'charg':190 'charter':533 'children':520,527 'china':204 'clean':420 'clear':414 'clear-cut':413 'clerk':197,247 'cloud':573 'cluster':298 'cod':465 'color':7,378,632 'connecticut':474 'convers':74 'countri':684 'cover':347 'cow':148 'crook':45 'curious':412 'custom':181 'cut':415 'dead':272 'decent':406 'desert':82 'dishpan':157 'distanc':315 'door':179 'doorway':421 'dooryard':71 'drive':196 'dug':107 'earli':77 'earth':603 'eastern':385 'egg':58 'elm':320 'elm-shad':319 'england':21,246,555,643,653,661 'everi':338 'everywher':16,113,116 'eye':51,391 'fals':3,374,628 'familiar':536 'fed':273 'flaunt':170 'flit':222 'flood':495 'flower':14,407,410,417,676 'foot':540 'forgotten':383 'fragranc':172 'friend':369,422 'fro':543 'full':617 'garden':524 'ghost':282 'give':146 'glass':366 'go':135 'gold':168 'good':149 'goos':210,214 'goose-quil':209,213 'grape':371 'grass':88 'graveyard':280 'great':11,335,494 'green':304,589 'greenhous':352 'hair':294 'hampshir':457 'heart':25,507,636 'heart-leav':635 'heart-shap':24 'high':228 'hill':110,310 'hold':72 'home':345 'hop':30 'hous':83,182,426,531 'house-cat':425 'housewif':154 'hundr':443 'hurri':362 'hurry-word':361 'husband':163 'imag':165 'insid':372 'inventori':249 'island':473 'jewel':399 'kite':329 'know':449,458,548 'leaf':503 'leaf-shap':502 'lean':354 'leav':27,599,637,670 'ledger':243,251 'let':291 'letter':236 'letter-sheet':235 'light':63,618 'like':31,392 'lilac':1,2,9,69,79,93,373,380,551,621,627,634,639,646,654 'littl':39,324,526 'long':314 'lopsid':100 'love':516 'main':448 'make':433 'mani':260 'marbl':331 'march':581 'massachusett':461 'may':217,549,556,570,586,593,600,615 'men':212,216 'milk':150 'mine':704 'month':220 'moon':78 'moonlight':440 'much':595 'music':33 'music-box':32 'narragansett':625 'new':20,245,456,554,642,652,660 'night':258 'nighttim':289 'nobodi':342 'nose':192 'old':91 'one':339 'open':610 'orang':28 'origin':386 'oriol':29 'pair':430 'pale':281 'panther':393 'paradox':244 'park':336 'pasha':400 'pastur':143 'pasture-bar':142 'peer':59 'persuad':152 'pine':576 'pine-tre':575 'plant':284 'poetri':232,434 'preach':124 'preacher':123 'prop':241 'propped-up':240 'puf':578 'puff':12 'pure':167 'purpl':6,377,631 'quiet':73 'quill':195,211,215 'quill-driv':194 'ran':128 'reach':312 'read':252 'recollect':522 'restless':60 'retic':409 'rhode':472 'river':479 'road':92,131,546 'root':644,664 'sandal':186 'sandal-wood':185 'say':359 'school':137 'sea':305,482 'sell':328 'sermon':126 'settl':84 'shade':321 'shadow':65 'shape':26,504 'sharp':446 'sheet':237 'ship':200 'shock':101 'shop':325 'side':350 'sideway':85 'silver':160 'sinc':700 'sing':37,560,693 'sit':55 'sky':585 'slant':277 'small':598 'smell':511 'soft':41,602 'soil':650 'solomon':256 'song':42,53,254 'soul':498 'south':613 'sparrow':54 'speak':687 'spectacl':432 'spot':57 'spring':68 'stagger':97 'stand':418 'start':466 'state':530 'stem':299 'stone':278,309 'stood':139 'stool':229 'street':322 'summer':514 'sun':561,596 'sweeter':488 'swollen':395 'take':475 'tap':118 'tea':189 'thin':293 'thrush':559 'time':265 'tip':566 'tip-top':565 'top':357,567 'tread':537 'tree':569,577 'tulip':490 'turban':397 'two':445 'upon':582 'veil':388 'vermont':463 'vers':261 'voic':699 'walk':340 'watch':80 'weak':40 'white':5,376,572,630 'wide':178 'wind':95,614,619 'wind-beaten':94 'window':120,609 'wive':518 'women':389 'wood':187 'word':363 'write':248 'writh':225 'wrote':231 'year':453,455

It cleaves the water into flaws like a jewel, and cracks it to bright light.        Little spots of sunshine lie on the surface of the water and dance, dance, and their reflections wobble deliciously over the ceiling; a stir of my finger sets them whirring, reeling. I move a foot and the planes of light in the water jar. I lie back and laugh, and let the green-white water, the sun-flawed beryl water, flow over me. The day is almost too bright to bear, the green water covers me from the too bright day. I will lie here awhile and play with the water and the sun spots. The sky is blue and high.

He circled the car\rKicking the tires, eyeing\rThe grille that still grinned the ribbed wings \rOf a sparrow. He looked inside and flies \rLifted like patted dust, settling\rInto a loose knot on the visor.\r“Yeh, you’re right as right ... it’s a ’50,” \rRhinehardt spat, his tongue rolling\rA false tooth into place. “It’s got no\rRunning board.” He pressed a buck\rInto his son’s hand and retired to the porch \rWhere he towel-flicked\rHis wife from a chair\rAnd as evening came on watched beyond \rThe street, a kennel of trees,\rWhereas he had dreameda plane would drop \rAnd bloom fire.

605	Teaching English from an Old Composition Book	262		\nMy chalk is no longer than a chip of fingernail, Chip by which I must explain this Monday Night the verbs “to get;” “to wear,” “to cut.” I’m not given much, these tired students, Knuckle-wrapped from work as roofers, Sour from scrubbing toilets and pedestal sinks. I’m given this room with five windows, A coffee machine, a piano with busted strings, The music of how we feel as the sun falls, Exhausted from keeping up.                                        I stand at The blackboard. The chalk is worn to a hangnail, Nearly gone, the dust of some educational bone. By and by I’m Cantiflas, the comic Busybody in front. I say, “I get the coffee.” I pick up a coffee cup and sip. I click my heels and say, “I wear my shoes.” I bring an invisible fork to my mouth And say, “I eat the chicken.” Suddenly the class is alive— Each one putting on hats and shoes, Drinking sodas and beers, cutting flowers And steaks—a pantomime of sumptuous living. At break I pass out cookies. Augustine, the Guatemalan, asks in Spanish, “Teacher, what is ‘tally-ho’?” I look at the word in the composition book. I raise my face to the bare bulb for a blind answer. I stutter, then say, “Es como adelante.” Augustine smiles, then nudges a friend In the next desk, now smarter by one word. After the cookies are eaten, We move ahead to prepositions— “Under,” “over,” and “between,” Useful words when la migra opens the doors Of their idling vans. At ten to nine, I’m tired of acting, And they’re tired of their roles. When class ends, I clap my hands of chalk dust, And two students applaud, thinking it’s a new verb. I tell them adelante, And they pick up their old books. They smile and, in return, cry, “Tally-ho.” As they head for the door.\n	'act':276 'adelant':226,307 'ahead':249 'aliv':160 'answer':219 'applaud':297 'ask':190 'augustin':187,227 'bare':214 'beer':171 'blackboard':91 'blind':218 'bone':106 'book':7,207,314 'break':182 'bring':143 'bulb':215 'bust':71 'busybodi':115 'cantifla':112 'chalk':9,93,292 'chicken':155 'chip':15,18 'clap':288 'class':158,285 'click':133 'coffe':66,123,128 'comic':114 'como':225 'composit':6,206 'cooki':186,244 'cri':320 'cup':129 'cut':34,172 'desk':236 'door':263,329 'drink':168 'dust':102,293 'eat':153 'eaten':246 'educ':105 'end':286 'english':2 'es':224 'exhaust':83 'explain':23 'face':211 'fall':82 'feel':78 'fingernail':17 'five':63 'flower':173 'fork':146 'friend':232 'front':117 'get':30,121 'given':38,59 'gone':100 'guatemalan':189 'hand':290 'hangnail':98 'hat':165 'head':326 'heel':135 'ho':198,323 'idl':266 'invis':145 'keep':85 'knuckl':44 'knuckle-wrap':43 'la':259 'live':180 'longer':12 'look':200 'm':36,58,111,273 'machin':67 'migra':260 'monday':25 'mouth':149 'move':248 'much':39 'music':74 'must':22 'near':99 'new':302 'next':235 'night':26 'nine':271 'nudg':230 'old':5,313 'one':162,240 'open':261 'pantomim':177 'pass':184 'pedest':55 'piano':69 'pick':125,310 'preposit':251 'put':163 'rais':209 're':279 'return':319 'role':283 'roofer':49 'room':61 'say':119,137,151,223 'scrub':52 'shoe':141,167 'sink':56 'sip':131 'smarter':238 'smile':228,316 'soda':169 'sour':50 'spanish':192 'stand':88 'steak':175 'string':72 'student':42,296 'stutter':221 'sudden':156 'sumptuous':179 'sun':81 'talli':197,322 'tally-ho':196,321 'teach':1 'teacher':193 'tell':305 'ten':269 'think':298 'tire':41,274,280 'toilet':53 'two':295 'use':256 'van':267 'verb':28,303 'wear':32,139 'window':64 'word':203,241,257 'work':47 'worn':95 'wrap':45

663	The Bridge	163		\nI stood on the bridge at midnight,    As the clocks were striking the hour, And the moon rose o'er the city,    Behind the dark church-tower.  I saw her bright reflection    In the waters under me, Like a golden goblet falling    And sinking into the sea.  And far in the hazy distance    Of that lovely night in June, The blaze of the flaming furnace    Gleamed redder than the moon.  Among the long, black rafters    The wavering shadows lay, And the current that came from the ocean    Seemed to lift and bear them away;  As, sweeping and eddying through them,    Rose the belated tide, And, streaming into the moonlight,    The seaweed floated wide.  And like those waters rushing    Among the wooden piers, A flood of thoughts came o’er me    That filled my eyes with tears.  How often, O, how often,    In the days that had gone by, I had stood on that bridge at midnight    And gazed on that wave and sky!  How often, O, how often,    I had wished that the ebbing tide Would bear me away on its bosom    O’er the ocean wild and wide!  For my heart was hot and restless,    And my life was full of care, And the burden laid upon me    Seemed greater than I could bear.  But now it has fallen from me,    It is buried in the sea; And only the sorrow of others    Throws its shadow over me.  Yet whenever I cross the river    On its bridge with wooden piers, Like the odor of brine from the ocean    Comes the thought of other years.  And I think how many thousands    Of care-encumbered men, Each bearing his burden of sorrow,    Have crossed the bridge since then.  I see the long procession    Still passing to and fro, The young heart hot and restless,    And the old subdued and slow!  And forever and forever,    As long as the river flows, As long as the heart has passions,    As long as life has woes;  The moon and its broken reflection    And its shadows shall appear, As the symbol of love in heaven,    And its wavering image here. \n	'among':74,122 'appear':347 'away':97,182 'bear':95,180,218,281 'behind':25 'belat':106 'black':77 'blaze':64 'bosom':185 'bridg':2,7,157,251,289 'bright':34 'brine':259 'broken':341 'burden':209,283 'buri':228 'came':87,130 'care':206,277 'care-encumb':276 'church':29 'church-tow':28 'citi':24 'clock':12 'come':263 'could':217 'cross':246,287 'current':85 'dark':27 'day':147 'distanc':56 'eb':177 'eddi':101 'encumb':278 'er':22,132,187 'eye':137 'fall':45 'fallen':223 'far':52 'fill':135 'flame':67 'float':115 'flood':127 'flow':323 'forev':315,317 'fro':301 'full':204 'furnac':68 'gaze':161 'gleam':69 'goblet':44 'golden':43 'gone':150 'greater':214 'hazi':55 'heart':195,304,328 'heaven':354 'hot':197,305 'hour':16 'imag':358 'june':62 'laid':210 'lay':82 'life':202,334 'lift':93 'like':41,118,255 'long':76,295,319,325,332 'love':59,352 'mani':273 'men':279 'midnight':9,159 'moon':19,73,338 'moonlight':112 'night':60 'o':21,131,142,169,186 'ocean':90,189,262 'odor':257 'often':141,144,168,171 'old':310 'other':237 'pass':298 'passion':330 'pier':125,254 'process':296 'rafter':78 'redder':70 'reflect':35,342 'restless':199,307 'river':248,322 'rose':20,104 'rush':121 'saw':32 'sea':50,231 'seawe':114 'see':293 'seem':91,213 'shadow':81,240,345 'shall':346 'sinc':290 'sink':47 'sky':166 'slow':313 'sorrow':235,285 'still':297 'stood':4,154 'stream':109 'strike':14 'subdu':311 'sweep':99 'symbol':350 'tear':139 'think':271 'thought':129,265 'thousand':274 'throw':238 'tide':107,178 'tower':30 'upon':211 'water':38,120 'wave':164 'waver':80,357 'whenev':244 'wide':116,192 'wild':190 'wish':174 'woe':336 'wooden':124,253 'would':179 'year':268 'yet':243 'young':303

Now the bridge is illuminated, twin arches rising, chalky, incandescent, light abandoning the dome of sky, river breathing azure, its surface frazzled, the moon leaving her scuff marks. Near the open window, dark of leaves. Outside at dawn, the sun hidden, a crow lowering itself on black wings crosses before windows as gold as Rome. The telephone, her mouth open.

637	Gnostic	268		\nWhen I wake up, I can remember touching the back of your neck, the cut of your hair blunt under my fingers. In the dream you have met my mother. My sisters and I are living in a grand house where I have no room of my own. One of my sisters has delineated her property by stringing a rope from which she will hang photographs of our dead father. At the beginning of Christianity, a bishop established what is called the "canon of truth" in order to unify feuding believers into a single way of apprehending the sacred. His teachings excluded the workings of imagination as subjective, vulnerable to self-interest, and possibly insane. Your neck, the blunt cut of your hair sharp and fragrant on my fingers. You come to the big house, you have just met my mother at a party where curtains of royal blue fell to the floor. The music by Scarlatti. My hair is turning gray. I look in the mirror. The familiar dark hairs are fine and smooth, the white are rough and thick like the fiber of which clouds are woven. I want to pluck out the white hairs, but my tweezer falls through them like logic through the sense of dreams. I am getting old, soon it will be too late. Your hand will slide from my skin like silk falling from a polished table. In the big house you come to me, and I show you my rectangle of floor. It is here I will put my couch and desk, separated from my sister and her pictures of our dead father by the edges of my body, myself, my thinking. You consider me. We stand there for a while. My sister is attaching the large photographs of our father to a rope. I look into the mirror at my white hair. I have sworn I will never dye it, but now I must. The white hairs are growing as fast as snow falls across a landscape. Soon snow will obliterate the town and countryside, there will be no houses visible, cars will disappear under the mass of it, trees will become poignant marks on a dangerous blank. My sister strings photographs of our dead father along the rope, attaching them with small invisible clips. I wait for you. I think about your face, how you are becoming bald, and then I remember touching you for the first time, the back of your neck. I was wondering how to find you, what I would discover there. It made me almost cry that you stayed perfectly still, certain, it seemed, that what I was imparting was of utmost consequence. I moved my fingers tentatively, as if finding first knowledge in a terrain I could slip beneath, into a garden. I remembered that when I woke up. That and your sticky skin. Certain early Christian ideologues denigrated imagination as outside the realms of good and evil. My mother is no longer dead, and you have met her. The air is transparent, the colors dark wood and pale amber. I am standing at the mirror watching white hair grow in as fast as snow. What time is the train coming? You sit at the window, your legs crossed. Courtly and at ease, you scrutinize my face until I am self-conscious. I become aware that you are waiting for me. I don't know how to get to you. Some early Christians, those who came to be persecuted as heretics, believed that a part of God is perpetually hidden from us. In relation to that realm of the deity dwells imagination, unceasingly seeking understanding of what is concealed. I can see you on the window seat in an elegantly cut suit, as if wearing such clothes were a form of grace. I remember you in that suit, standing in the hotel, turning on your heel to look for me. Now the window is tall behind you, twilight gathering outside the glass, cedars black beyond the roses. I am not dead, yet I am mute as the dead usually are in dreams. You are speaking in a clear voice, explaining you have met my mother and that I look like her. Before sleep, I was reading about early Christianity. When I woke up from the long dream, there we were in the taxicab, my arms tentative around you, my fingers seeking the back of your neck. I felt clearly the blunt edge of your newly cut hair, the stickiness of your skin, that mortal stickiness– When my mother's mother was sixty, her hair was still dark. When my mother died at fifty, her hair was still black, though as she sickened, it turned white, black receding as life did. I stand at the mirror, its rare wide-beveled glass framed by oak carved to leaves and flowers. I am scrutinizing myself. My face is not ageing, but my hair is turning white, cloaking the trees, falling on the meadow, windblown across the frozen lake. What heresy is it that you come to me in a dream, knowing everything?

638	Aubade	269		\nIt seemed as if we did not sleep One wink that night; I was sighing deep. The cruellest judge in the costliest court Could not condemn a night so short. We had the light out, but I know, Each time I turned, a radiant glow Suffused the room, and shining snow Alit from Heaven’s candle-fires Illuminated our desires. But the last time I held her, strong, Excited, closest, very long, Something started to go wrong. The edge of dawn’s despotic veil Showed at the eastern window-pale And there it was,—the morning light! Gwen was seized with a fearful fright, Became an apparition, cried, “Get up, go now with God, go hide! “Love is a salt, a gall, a rue, A vinegar-vintage. Dos y Ddw, Vaya con Dios, quickly, too!” “Ah, not yet, never yet, my love; The stars and moon still shine above.” “Then why do the raucous ravens talk With such a loud insistent squawk?” “Crows always cry like that, when fleas Nibble their ankles, nip their knees.” “And why do the dogs yip, yammer, yell?” “They think they’ve caught a fox’s smell.” “Poet, the wisdom of a fool Offers poor counsel as a rule. Open the door, open it wide As fast as you can, and leap outside. The dogs are fierce when they get untied.” “The woods are only a bound from here, And I can outjump a deer, my dear!” “But tell me, best beloved of men, Will you come again? Will you come again?” “Gwen, you know I’m your nightingale, And I’ll be with you, without fail, When the cloud is cloak, and the dark is sky, And when the night comes, so will I.”\n	'ah':140 'alit':53 'alway':168 'ankl':176 'apparit':110 'aubad':1 'becam':108 'belov':251 'best':250 'bound':236 'candl':58 'candle-fir':57 'caught':192 'cloak':281 'closest':72 'cloud':279 'come':256,260,291 'con':136 'condemn':27 'costliest':23 'could':25 'counsel':205 'court':24 'cri':111,169 'crow':167 'cruellest':19 'dark':284 'dawn':83 'ddw':134 'dear':246 'deep':17 'deer':244 'desir':62 'despot':85 'dio':137 'dog':184,224 'door':211 'dos':132 'eastern':90 'edg':81 'excit':71 'fail':276 'fast':216 'fear':106 'fierc':226 'fire':59 'flea':173 'fool':202 'fox':194 'fright':107 'gall':125 'get':112,229 'glow':46 'go':78,114,118 'god':117 'gwen':101,262 'heaven':55 'held':68 'hide':119 'illumin':60 'insist':165 'judg':20 'knee':179 'know':39,264 'last':65 'leap':221 'light':35,100 'like':170 'll':271 'long':74 'loud':164 'love':120,146 'm':266 'men':253 'moon':150 'morn':99 'never':143 'nibbl':174 'night':13,29,290 'nightingal':268 'nip':177 'offer':203 'one':10 'open':209,212 'outjump':242 'outsid':222 'pale':93 'poet':197 'poor':204 'quick':138 'radiant':45 'raucous':158 'raven':159 'room':49 'rue':127 'rule':208 'salt':123 'seem':3 'seiz':103 'shine':51,152 'short':31 'show':87 'sigh':16 'sky':286 'sleep':9 'smell':196 'snow':52 'someth':75 'squawk':166 'star':148 'start':76 'still':151 'strong':70 'suffus':47 'talk':160 'tell':248 'think':189 'time':41,66 'turn':43 'unti':230 'vaya':135 've':191 'veil':86 'vinegar':130 'vinegar-vintag':129 'vintag':131 'wide':214 'window':92 'window-pal':91 'wink':11 'wisdom':199 'without':275 'wood':232 'wrong':79 'y':133 'yammer':186 'yell':187 'yet':142,144 'yip':185
639	The Winter	269		\nAcross North Wales The snowflakes wander, A swarm of white bees. Over the woods A cold veil lies. A load of chalk  Bows down the trees. No undergrowth Without its wool, No field unsheeted;  No path is left Through any field; On every stump White flour is milled. Will someone tell me What angels lift  Planks in the flour-loft Floor of heaven Shaking down dust? An angel’s cloak Is cold quicksilver. And here below The big drifts blow, Blow and billow Across the heather Like swollen bellies. The frozen foam Falls in fleeces. Out of my house I will not stir For any girl To have my coat Look like a miller’s  Or stuck with feathers Of eider down. What a great fall Lies on my country! A wide wall, stretching One sea to the other,  Greater and graver Than the sea’s graveyard.

642	Song from The Indian Emperor	271		\nAh, fading joy, how quickly art thou past!       Yet we thy ruin haste. As if the cares of human life were few,       We seek out new: And follow fate, which would too fast pursue. See how on every bough the birds express       In their sweet notes their happiness.       They all enjoy and nothing spare; But on their mother nature lay their care. Why then should man, the lord of all below,       Such troubles choose to know As none of all his subjects undergo? Hark, hark, the waters fall, fall, fall,       And with a murmuring sound       Dash, dash upon the ground,          To gentle slumbers call.\n	'ah':6 'art':11 'bird':46 'bough':44 'call':109 'care':22,67 'choos':79 'dash':101,102 'emperor':5 'enjoy':56 'everi':43 'express':47 'fade':7 'fall':93,94,95 'fast':38 'fate':34 'follow':33 'gentl':107 'ground':105 'happi':53 'hark':89,90 'hast':18 'human':24 'indian':4 'joy':8 'know':81 'lay':65 'life':25 'lord':73 'man':71 'mother':63 'murmur':99 'natur':64 'new':31 'none':83 'note':51 'noth':58 'past':13 'pursu':39 'quick':10 'ruin':17 'see':40 'seek':29 'slumber':108 'song':1 'sound':100 'spare':59 'subject':87 'sweet':50 'thi':16 'thou':12 'troubl':78 'undergo':88 'upon':103 'water':92 'would':36 'yet':14

It was never for the mean; It requireth courage stout. Souls above doubt, Valor unbending, It will reward,— They shall return More than they were, And ever ascending. Leave all for love; Yet, hear me, yet, One word more thy heart behoved, One pulse more of firm endeavor,— Keep thee to-day, To-morrow, forever, Free as an Arab Of thy beloved. Cling with life to the maid; But when the surprise, First vague shadow of surmise Flits across her bosom young, Of a joy apart from thee, Free be she, fancy-free; Nor thou detain her vesture’s hem, Nor the palest rose she flung From her summer diadem. Though thou loved her as thyself, As a self of purer clay, Though her parting dims the day, Stealing grace from all alive; Heartily know, When half-gods go,   The gods arrive.\n	'across':149 'aliv':204 'apart':156 'arab':129 'arriv':214 'ascend':96 'behov':110 'belov':132 'beyond':39 'bosom':151 'brave':29 'clay':193 'cling':133 'courag':77 'credit':20 'day':14,121,199 'detain':167 'diadem':181 'dim':197 'dive':46 'doubt':81 'endeavor':116 'estat':15 'ever':95 'fame':18 'fanci':163 'fancy-fre':162 'firm':115 'first':143 'flit':148 'flung':177 'follow':35 'forev':125 'free':126,159,164 'friend':12 'give':1,5 'go':211 'god':58,210,213 'good':17 'good-fam':16 'grace':201 'half':209 'half-god':208 'hear':102 'heart':11,109 'heartili':205 'hem':171 'high':41,44 'hope':38,40 'intent':53 'joy':155 'keep':117 'kindr':13 'know':59,206 'leav':97 'let':31 'life':135 'love':4,8,100,184 'maid':138 'master':30 'mean':74 'morrow':124 'muse':23 'never':71 'noon':48 'noth':24 'obey':9 'one':105,111 'outlet':65 'palest':174 'part':196 'path':62 'plan':19 'puls':112 'purer':192 'refus':25 'requireth':76 'return':89 'reward':86 'rose':175 'scope':34 'self':190 'shadow':145 'shall':88 'sky':68 'soul':79 'steal':200 'stout':78 'summer':180 'surmis':147 'surpris':142 'thee':118,158 'thi':10,108,131 'thou':166,183 'though':182,194 'thyself':187 'to-day':119 'to-morrow':122 'unbend':83 'unspent':51 'untold':52 'utter':37 'vagu':144 'valor':82 'vestur':169 'wing':50 'word':106 'yet':101,104 'young':152
665	Thanatopsis	281		\n     To him who in the love of Nature holds   Communion with her visible forms, she speaks   A various language; for his gayer hours   She has a voice of gladness, and a smile   And eloquence of beauty, and she glides   Into his darker musings, with a mild   And healing sympathy, that steals away   Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts   Of the last bitter hour come like a blight   Over thy spirit, and sad images   Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,   And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,   Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;—   Go forth, under the open sky, and list   To Nature’s teachings, while from all around— Earth and her waters, and the depths of air— Comes a still voice—                                        Yet a few days, and thee   The all-beholding sun shall see no more   In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,   Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,   Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist   Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim   Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again, And, lost each human trace, surrendering up   Thine individual being, shalt thou go   To mix for ever with the elements,   To be a brother to the insensible rock   And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain   Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak   Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.        Yet not to thine eternal resting-place   Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish   Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down   With patriarchs of the infant world—with kings,   The powerful of the earth—the wise, the good,   Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,   All in one mighty sepulchre.   The hills   Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,—the vales   Stretching in pensive quietness between;   The venerable woods—rivers that move   In majesty, and the complaining brooks   That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,   Old Ocean’s gray and melancholy waste,—   Are but the solemn decorations all   Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,   The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,   Are shining on the sad abodes of death,   Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread   The globe are but a handful to the tribes   That slumber in its bosom.—Take the wings   Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,   Or lose thyself in the continuous woods   Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,   Save his own dashings—yet the dead are there:   And millions in those solitudes, since first   The flight of years began, have laid them down   In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone. So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw   In silence from the living, and no friend   Take note of thy departure? All that breathe   Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care   Plod on, and each one as before will chase   His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave   Their mirth and their employments, and shall come And make their bed with thee. As the long train   Of ages glide away, the sons of men,   The youth in life’s green spring, and he who goes   In the full strength of years, matron and maid,   The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man—   Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,   By those, who in their turn shall follow them.        So live, that when thy summons comes to join   The innumerable caravan, which moves   To that mysterious realm, where each shall take   His chamber in the silent halls of death,   Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,   Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed   By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,   Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch   About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\n	'abod':369 'abroad':238 'age':289,377,531 'agoni':80 'air':125 'all-behold':137 'alon':254,452 'ancient':302 'approach':637 'around':116 'art':488 'awar':59 'away':53,533 'babe':560 'barcan':402 'beauti':37 'bed':523 'began':439 'behold':139 'bitter':65 'blight':70 'bosom':394 'breath':477 'breathless':86 'brood':492 'brook':324 'brother':211 'caravan':596 'care':494 'chamber':608 'chase':503 'claim':179 'clod':220 'cold':153 'come':67,126,519,591 'communion':11 'complain':323 'continu':409 'couch':259,648 'couldst':256 'cours':148 'dark':87 'darker':43 'dash':422 'day':133 'dead':425,449 'death':371,614 'decor':345 'departur':474 'depth':123 'destini':481 'draperi':645 'dream':656 'dungeon':628 'earth':117,174,186,278 'element':207 'eloqu':35 'embrac':167 'employ':516 'ere':56 'etern':247 'ever':204 'exist':171 'fair':283 'favorit':505 'first':434 'flight':436 'follow':583 'form':15,158,284 'forth':102 'friend':469 'full':551 'gather':572 'gay':483 'gayer':23 'glad':30 'glide':40,532 'globe':382 'go':101,200,616 'goe':548 'golden':354 'gone':489 'good':282 'grave':639 'gray':337,564 'gray-head':563 'great':349 'green':329,543 'ground':154 'grow':97 'growth':181 'hall':612 'hand':386 'head':565 'heal':49 'hear':416 'heart':100 'heaven':363 'hill':297 'hoari':286 'hold':10 'host':361 'hour':24,66 'hous':91 'human':191 'imag':76,173 'individu':196 'infant':270 'infinit':360 'innumer':595 'insens':214 'join':593 'king':273 'laid':160,441 'languag':20 'laps':375 'last':64,446 'laugh':485 'leav':511 'lie':264,652 'life':541 'like':68,618,640 'list':108 'live':466,586 'long':528 'lose':405 'lost':189 'love':7 'magnific':261 'maid':557 'majesti':320 'make':92,326,521 'man':352,566 'mani':162 'matron':555 'meadow':328 'melancholi':339 'men':537 'mighti':294 'mild':47 'million':429 'mirth':513 'mix':202 'morn':399 'mould':242 'move':318,598 'muse':44 'mysteri':601 'narrow':90 'natur':9,110 'night':624 'note':471 'nourish':176 'oak':233 'ocean':169,335 'old':334 'one':293,499,568,570,641 'open':105 'oregon':414 'pale':157 'pall':84 'past':290 'patriarch':267 'pensiv':310 'phantom':506 'pierc':240,400 'place':250 'planet':357 'pleasant':655 'plod':495 'pour':331 'power':275 'quarri':621 'quarry-slav':620 'quiet':311 'realm':602 'reign':450 'resolv':184 'rest':249,456 'resting-plac':248 'retir':253 'rib':300 'river':316 'rock':215,299 'rock-rib':298 'roll':412 'root':237 'round':332 'rude':223 'sad':75,368 'save':419 'scourg':625 'see':142 'seer':287 'send':235 'sepulchr':295 'shall':141,170,178,234,510,518,567,582,605 'shalt':198,251,263,454 'share':228,479 'sharp':55 'shine':365 'shroud':82 'shudder':95 'sick':98 'side':575 'silenc':463 'silent':611 'sinc':433 'sky':106 'slave':622 'sleep':447 'sluggish':219 'slumber':391 'smile':33 'solemn':344,491 'solitud':432 'son':535 'sooth':632 'sound':418 'speak':17 'speechless':559 'spirit':73 'spring':544 'steal':52 'stern':79 'still':128,374 'strength':552 'stretch':308 'summon':590 'sun':140,305,355 'surrend':193 'sustain':630 'swain':224 'sympathi':50 'take':395,470,606 'teach':112 'tear':163 'thanatopsi':1 'thee':93,135,177,525 'thi':72,156,172,180,241,473,480,574,589,638 'thine':195,246 'thou':199,252,257,262,455,460,487,615 'thought':61 'thyself':406 'tomb':350 'trace':192 'train':529 'tread':230,380 'tribe':389 'trust':636 'turn':225,581 'unfalt':635 'upon':231 'vale':307 'various':19 'vener':314 'visibl':14 'voic':28,129 'wast':340 'water':120 'wilder':403 'wing':397 'wise':280 'wish':258 'withdraw':461 'wood':315,410 'world':271 'wrap':643 'year':438,554 'yet':130,150,243,423,507 'youth':539
666	from Fanny	282		\nI Fanny was younger once than she is now,     And prettier of course: I do not mean  To say that there are wrinkles on her brow;     Yet, to be candid, she is past eighteen—  Perhaps past twenty—but the girl is shy  About her age, and Heaven forbid that I  II Should get myself in trouble by revealing     A secret of this sort; I have too long  Loved pretty women with a poet’s feeling,     And when a boy, in day dream and in song,  Have knelt me down and worshipp’d them: alas!  They never thank’d me for’t—but let that pass.  V Her father kept, some fifteen years ago,     A retail dry-good shop in Chatham-street,  And nursed his little earnings, sure though slow,     Till, having muster’d wherewithal to meet  The gaze of the great world, he breathed the air  Of Pearl-street—and "set up" in Hanover-square.  VI Money is power, ’tis said—I never tried;     I’m but a poet—and bank-notes to me  Are curiosities, as closely eyed,     Whene’er I get them, as a stone would be,  Toss’d from the moon on Doctor Mitchill’s table,  Or classic brickbat from the tower of Babel.  VII But he I sing of well has known and felt     That money hath a power and a dominion;  For when in Chatham-street the good man dwelt,     No one would give a sous for his opinion.  And though his neighbours were extremely civil,  Yet, on the whole, they thought him—a poor devil,  VIII A decent kind of person; one whose head     Was not of brains particularly full;  It was not known that he had ever said     Any thing worth repeating—’twas a dull,  Good, honest man—what Paulding’s muse would call  A “cabbage head”—but he excelled them all  IX In that most noble of the sciences,     The art of making money; and he found  The zeal for quizzing him grew less and less,     As he grew richer; till upon the ground  Of Pearl-street, treading proudly in the might  And majesty of wealth, a sudden light  X Flash’d like the midnight lightning on the eyes     Of all who knew him; brilliant traits of mind,  And genius, clear and countless as the dies     Upon the peacock’s plumage; taste refined,  Wisdom and wit, were his—perhaps much more.  ’Twas strange they had not found it out before.  XXV Dear to the exile is his native land,     In memory’s twilight beauty seen afar:  Dear to the broker is a note of hand,     Collaterally secured—the polar star  Is dear at midnight to the sailor’s eyes,  And dear are Bristed’s volumes at “half price;” XXVI But dearer far to me each fairy minute     Spent in that fond forgetfulness of grief;  There is an airy web of magic in it,     As in Othello’s pocket-handkerchief,  Veiling the wrinkles on the brow of sorrow,  The gathering gloom to-day, the thunder cloud to-morrow.  XLI  Since that wise pedant, Johnson, was in fashion,     Manners have changed as well as moons; and he  Would fret himself once more into a passion,     Should he return (which heaven forbid!), and see,  How strangely from his standard dictionary,  The meaning of some words is made to vary.  XLII For instance, an undress at present means     The wearing a pelisse, a shawl, or so;  Or any thing you please, in short, that screens     The face, and hides the form from top to toe;  Of power to brave a quizzing-glass, or storm— ’Tis worn in summer, when the weather’s warm.  XLIII  But a full dress is for a winter’s night.     The most genteel is made of "woven air;"  That kind of classic cobweb, soft and light,     Which Lady Morgan’s Ida used to wear.  And ladies, this aërial manner dress'd in,  Look Eve-like, angel-like, and interesting.  \n	'afar':433 'age':47 'ago':115 'air':150,639 'airi':485 'ala':96 'angel':669 'angel-lik':668 'art':327 'aërial':659 'babel':214 'bank':178 'bank-not':177 'beauti':431 'boy':81 'brain':282 'brave':605 'breath':148 'brickbat':209 'brilliant':382 'brist':460 'broker':437 'brow':28,503 'cabbag':311 'call':309 'candid':32 'chang':529 'chatham':124,238 'chatham-street':123,237 'civil':259 'classic':208,643 'clear':388 'close':185 'cloud':514 'cobweb':644 'collater':443 'countless':390 'cours':15 'curios':183 'd':94,100,137,198,369,662 'day':83,511 'dear':419,434,449,458 'dearer':468 'decent':272 'devil':269 'dictionari':557 'die':393 'doctor':203 'dominion':233 'dream':84 'dress':625,661 'dri':119 'dry-good':118 'dull':300 'dwelt':243 'earn':130 'eighteen':36 'er':188 'eve':666 'eve-lik':665 'ever':292 'excel':315 'exil':422 'extrem':258 'eye':186,376,456 'face':593 'fairi':473 'fanni':2,4 'far':469 'fashion':526 'father':110 'feel':77 'felt':225 'fifteen':113 'flash':368 'fond':478 'forbid':50,549 'forget':479 'form':597 'found':333,414 'fret':537 'full':284,624 'gather':507 'gaze':142 'genius':387 'genteel':634 'get':55,190 'girl':42 'give':247 'glass':609 'gloom':508 'good':120,241,301 'great':145 'grew':339,345 'grief':481 'ground':350 'half':464 'hand':442 'handkerchief':497 'hanov':160 'hanover-squar':159 'hath':228 'head':278,312 'heaven':49,548 'hide':595 'honest':302 'ida':652 'ii':53 'instanc':569 'interest':672 'ix':318 'johnson':523 'kept':111 'kind':273,641 'knelt':89 'knew':380 'known':223,288 'ladi':649,657 'land':426 'less':340,342 'let':105 'light':366,647 'lightn':373 'like':370,667,670 'littl':129 'long':69 'look':664 'love':70 'm':172 'made':564,636 'magic':488 'majesti':361 'make':329 'man':242,303 'manner':527,660 'mean':19,559,574 'meet':140 'memori':428 'midnight':372,451 'might':359 'mind':385 'minut':474 'mitchil':204 'money':163,227,330 'moon':201,533 'morgan':650 'morrow':517 'much':407 'muse':307 'muster':136 'nativ':425 'neighbour':256 'never':98,169 'night':631 'nobl':322 'note':179,440 'nurs':127 'one':245,276 'opinion':252 'othello':493 'particular':283 'pass':107 'passion':543 'past':35,38 'pauld':305 'peacock':396 'pearl':153,353 'pearl-street':152,352 'pedant':522 'peliss':578 'perhap':37,406 'person':275 'pleas':587 'plumag':398 'pocket':496 'pocket-handkerchief':495 'poet':75,175 'polar':446 'poor':268 'power':165,230,603 'present':573 'pretti':71 'prettier':13 'price':465 'proud':356 'quizz':337,608 'quizzing-glass':607 'refin':400 'repeat':297 'retail':117 'return':546 'reveal':60 'richer':346 'said':167,293 'sailor':454 'say':21 'scienc':325 'screen':591 'secret':62 'secur':444 'see':551 'seen':432 'set':156 'shawl':580 'shi':44 'shop':121 'short':589 'sinc':519 'sing':219 'slow':133 'soft':645 'song':87 'sorrow':505 'sort':65 'sous':249 'spent':475 'squar':161 'standard':556 'star':447 'stone':194 'storm':611 'strang':410,553 'street':125,154,239,354 'sudden':365 'summer':615 'sure':131 'tabl':206 'tast':399 'thank':99 'thing':295,585 'though':132,254 'thought':265 'thunder':513 'till':134,347 'tis':166,612 'to-day':509 'to-morrow':515 'toe':601 'top':599 'toss':197 'tower':212 'trait':383 'tread':355 'tri':170 'troubl':58 'twas':298,409 'twenti':39 'twilight':430 'undress':571 'upon':348,394 'use':653 'v':108 'vari':566 'veil':498 'vi':162 'vii':215 'viii':270 'volum':462 'warm':620 'wealth':363 'wear':576,655 'weather':618 'web':486 'well':221,531 'whene':187 'wherewith':138 'whole':263 'whose':277 'winter':629 'wisdom':401 'wise':521 'wit':403 'women':72 'word':562 'world':146 'worn':613 'worshipp':93 'worth':296 'would':195,246,308,536 'woven':638 'wrinkl':25,500 'x':367 'xli':518 'xlii':567 'xliii':621 'xxv':418 'xxvi':466 'year':114 'yet':29,260 'younger':6 'zeal':335
643	To Mr. Henry Lawes	210		\nNature, which is the vast creation’s soul, That steady curious agent in the whole, The art of Heaven, the order of this frame, Is only number in another name. For as some king conqu’ring what was his own, Hath choice of several titles to his crown; So harmony on this score now, that then, Yet still is all that takes and governs men. Beauty is but composure, and we find Content is but the concord of the mind, Friendship the unison of well-turned hearts, Honor the chorus of the noblest parts, And all the world on which we can reflect Music to th’ear, or to the intellect. If then each man a little world must be, How many worlds are copied out in thee, Who art so richly formed, so complete T’epitomize all that is good and great; Whose stars this brave advantage did impart, Thy nature’s as harmonious as thy art? Thou dost above the poets’ praises live, Who fetch from thee th’eternity they give. And as true reason triumphs over sense, Yet is subjected to intelligence: So poets on the lower world look down, But Lawes on them; his height is all his own. For, like Divinity it self, his lyre Rewards the wit it did at first inspire. And thus by double right poets allow  His and their laurel should adorn his brow. Live then, great soul of nature, to assuage The savage dulness of this sullen age. Charm us to sense; for though experience fail And reason too, thy numbers may prevail. Then, like those ancients, strike, and so command All nature to obey thy gen’rous hand. None will resist but such who needs will be More stupid than a stone, a fish, a tree. Be it thy care our age to new-create: What built a world may sure repair a state.\n	'adorn':236 'advantag':153 'age':253,308 'agent':16 'allow':230 'ancient':272 'anoth':33 'art':21,135,163 'assuag':246 'beauti':70 'brave':152 'brow':238 'built':314 'care':306 'charm':254 'choic':46 'chorus':95 'command':276 'complet':140 'composur':73 'concord':81 'conqu':39 'content':77 'copi':130 'creat':312 'creation':10 'crown':52 'curious':15 'divin':211 'dost':165 'doubl':227 'dul':249 'ear':112 'epitom':142 'etern':176 'experi':260 'fail':261 'fetch':172 'find':76 'first':222 'fish':300 'form':138 'frame':28 'friendship':85 'gen':282 'give':178 'good':146 'govern':68 'great':148,241 'hand':284 'harmoni':54,160 'hath':45 'heart':92 'heaven':23 'height':204 'henri':3 'honor':93 'impart':155 'inspir':223 'intellect':116 'intellig':190 'king':38 'laurel':234 'law':4,200 'like':210,270 'littl':122 'live':170,239 'look':197 'lower':195 'lyre':215 'man':120 'mani':127 'may':267,317 'men':69 'mind':84 'mr':2 'music':109 'must':124 'name':34 'natur':5,157,244,278 'need':291 'new':311 'new-creat':310 'noblest':98 'none':285 'number':31,266 'obey':280 'order':25 'part':99 'poet':168,192,229 'prais':169 'prevail':268 'reason':182,263 'reflect':108 'repair':319 'resist':287 'reward':216 'rich':137 'right':228 'ring':40 'rous':283 'savag':248 'score':57 'self':213 'sens':185,257 'sever':48 'soul':12,242 'star':150 'state':321 'steadi':14 'still':62 'stone':298 'strike':273 'stupid':295 'subject':188 'sullen':252 'sure':318 'take':66 'th':111,175 'thee':133,174 'thi':156,162,265,281,305 'thou':164 'though':259 'thus':225 'titl':49 'tree':302 'triumph':183 'true':181 'turn':91 'unison':87 'us':255 'vast':9 'well':90 'well-turn':89 'whole':19 'whose':149 'wit':218 'world':103,123,128,196,316 'yet':61,186
644	On the Welsh Language	210		\nIf honor to an ancient name be due, Or riches challenge it for one that’s new, The British language claims in either sense Both for its age, and for its opulence. But all great things must be from us removed, To be with higher reverence beloved. So landskips which in prospects distant lie, With greater wonder draw the pleasèd eye. Is not great Troy to one dark ruin hurled? Once the fam’d scene of all fighting world. Where’s Athens now, to whom Rome learning owes, And the safe laurels that adorned her brows? A strange reverse of fate she did endure, Never once greater, than she’s now obscure. Even Rome her self can but some footsteps show Of Scipio’s times, or those of Cicero. And as the Roman and the Grecian state, The British fell, the spoil of time and fate. But though the language hath the beauty lost, Yet she has still some great remains to boast. For ’twas in that, the sacred bards of old, In deathless numbers did their thoughts unfold. In groves, by rivers, and on fertile plains, They civilized and taught the listening swains; Whilst with high raptures, and as great success, Virtue they clothed in music’s charming dress. This Merlin spoke, who in his gloomy cave, Even Destiny her self seemed to enslave. For to his sight the future time was known, Much better than to others is their own; And with such state, predictions from him fell, As if he did decree, and not foretell. This spoke King Arthur, who, if fame be true, Could have compelled mankind to speak it too. In this once Boadicca valor taught, And spoke more nobly than her soldiers fought: Tell me what hero could be more than she, Who fell at once for fame and liberty? Nor could a greater sacrifice belong, Or to her children’s, or her country’s wrong. This spoke Caractacus, who was so brave, That to the Roman fortune check he gave: And when their yoke he could decline no more, He it so decently and nobly wore, That Rome her self with blushes did believe, A Britain would the law of honor give; And hastily his chains away she threw, Lest her own captive else should her subdue.\n	'adorn':98 'age':32 'ancient':9 'arthur':266 'athen':86 'away':378 'bard':174 'beauti':157 'believ':365 'belong':316 'belov':51 'better':240 'blush':363 'boadicca':283 'boast':167 'brave':333 'britain':367 'british':23,143 'brow':100 'captiv':384 'caractacus':329 'cave':222 'chain':377 'challeng':15 'charm':213 'check':339 'children':320 'cicero':133 'civil':193 'claim':25 'cloth':209 'compel':274 'could':272,298,312,347 'countri':324 'd':78 'dark':72 'deathless':178 'decent':354 'declin':348 'decre':259 'destini':224 'distant':57 'draw':62 'dress':214 'due':12 'either':27 'els':385 'endur':108 'enslav':229 'even':117,223 'eye':65 'fam':77 'fame':269,308 'fate':105,150 'fell':144,254,304 'fertil':190 'fight':82 'footstep':124 'foretel':262 'fortun':338 'fought':293 'futur':235 'gave':341 'give':373 'gloomi':221 'great':39,68,164,205 'greater':60,111,314 'grecian':140 'grove':185 'hastili':375 'hath':155 'hero':297 'high':201 'higher':49 'honor':6,372 'hurl':74 'king':265 'known':238 'landskip':53 'languag':4,24,154 'laurel':96 'law':370 'learn':91 'lest':381 'liberti':310 'lie':58 'listen':197 'lost':158 'mankind':275 'merlin':216 'much':239 'music':211 'must':41 'name':10 'never':109 'new':21 'nobli':289,356 'number':179 'obscur':116 'old':176 'one':18,71 'opul':36 'other':243 'owe':92 'plain':191 'pleasèd':64 'predict':251 'prospect':56 'raptur':202 'remain':165 'remov':45 'rever':50 'revers':103 'rich':14 'river':187 'roman':137,337 'rome':90,118,359 'ruin':73 'sacr':173 'sacrific':315 'safe':95 'scene':79 'scipio':127 'seem':227 'self':120,226,361 'sens':28 'show':125 'sight':233 'soldier':292 'speak':277 'spoil':146 'spoke':217,264,287,328 'state':141,250 'still':162 'strang':102 'subdu':388 'success':206 'swain':198 'taught':195,285 'tell':294 'thing':40 'though':152 'thought':182 'threw':380 'time':129,148,236 'troy':69 'true':271 'twas':169 'unfold':183 'us':44 'valor':284 'virtu':207 'welsh':3 'whilst':199 'wonder':61 'wore':357 'world':83 'would':368 'wrong':326 'yet':159 'yoke':345
645	To My Excellent Lucasia, on Our Friendship	210		\nI did not live until this time     Crowned my felicity, When I could say without a crime,     I am not thine, but thee. This carcass breathed, and walked, and slept,     So that the world believed  There was a soul the motions kept;     But they were all deceived. For as a watch by art is wound     To motion, such was mine: But never had Orinda found     A soul till she found thine; Which now inspires, cures and supplies,     And guides my darkened breast: For thou art all that I can prize,     My joy, my life, my rest. No bridegroom’s nor crown-conqueror’s mirth     To mine compared can be: They have but pieces of the earth,     I’ve all the world in thee. Then let our flames still light and shine,     And no false fear control, As innocent as our design,     Immortal as our soul.\n	'art':60,92 'believ':42 'breast':89 'breath':33 'bridegroom':105 'carcass':32 'compar':115 'conqueror':110 'control':144 'could':20 'crime':24 'crown':15,109 'crown-conqueror':108 'cure':82 'darken':88 'deceiv':54 'design':149 'earth':124 'excel':3 'fals':142 'fear':143 'felic':17 'flame':135 'found':72,77 'friendship':7 'guid':86 'immort':150 'innoc':146 'inspir':81 'joy':99 'kept':49 'let':133 'life':101 'light':137 'live':11 'lucasia':4 'mine':67,114 'mirth':112 'motion':48,64 'never':69 'orinda':71 'piec':121 'prize':97 'rest':103 'say':21 'shine':139 'slept':37 'soul':46,74,153 'still':136 'suppli':84 'thee':30,131 'thine':28,78 'thou':91 'till':75 'time':14 've':126 'walk':35 'watch':58 'without':22 'world':41,129 'wound':62
646	The Salutation	272		\nThese little limbs,     These eyes and hands which here I find, These rosy cheeks wherewith my life begins,     Where have ye been? behind What curtain were ye from me hid so long? Where was, in what abyss, my speaking tongue?          When silent I       So many thousand, thousand years Beneath the dust did in a chaos lie,     How could I smiles or tears, Or lips or hands or eyes or ears perceive? Welcome ye treasures which I now receive.          I that so long     Was nothing from eternity, Did little think such joys as ear or tongue     To celebrate or see: Such sounds to hear, such hands to feel, such feet, Beneath the skies on such a ground to meet.          New burnished joys,     Which yellow gold and pearls excel! Such sacred treasures are the limbs in boys,     In which a soul doth dwell; Their organizèd joints and azure veins More wealth include than all the world contains.          From dust I rise,     And out of nothing now awake; These brighter regions which salute mine eyes,     A gift from God I take. The earth, the seas, the light, the day, the skies, The sun and stars are mine if those I prize.          Long time before     I in my mother’s womb was born, A God, preparing, did this glorious store,     The world, for me adorn. Into this Eden so divine and fair, So wide and bright, I come His son and heir.          A stranger here     Strange things doth meet, strange glories see; Strange treasures lodged in this fair world appear,     Strange all and new to me; But that they mine should be, who nothing was, That strangest is of all, yet brought to pass.\n	'abyss':39 'adorn':223 'appear':258 'awak':167 'azur':148 'begin':20 'behind':25 'beneath':51,112 'born':211 'boy':137 'bright':234 'brighter':169 'brought':280 'burnish':122 'celebr':99 'chao':57 'cheek':16 'come':236 'contain':157 'could':60 'curtain':27 'day':188 'divin':228 'doth':142,246 'dust':53,159 'dwell':143 'ear':72,95 'earth':182 'eden':226 'etern':88 'excel':129 'eye':7,70,174 'fair':230,256 'feel':109 'feet':111 'find':13 'gift':176 'glori':249 'glorious':217 'god':178,213 'gold':126 'ground':118 'hand':9,68,107 'hear':105 'heir':240 'hid':32 'includ':152 'joint':146 'joy':93,123 'lie':58 'life':19 'light':186 'limb':5,135 'lip':66 'littl':4,90 'lodg':253 'long':34,84,201 'mani':47 'meet':120,247 'mine':173,196,268 'mother':207 'new':121,262 'noth':86,165,272 'organizèd':145 'pass':282 'pearl':128 'perceiv':73 'prepar':214 'prize':200 'receiv':80 'region':170 'rise':161 'rosi':15 'sacr':131 'salut':2,172 'sea':184 'see':101,250 'silent':44 'sky':114,190 'smile':62 'son':238 'soul':141 'sound':103 'speak':41 'star':194 'store':218 'strang':244,248,251,259 'stranger':242 'strangest':275 'sun':192 'take':180 'tear':64 'thing':245 'think':91 'thousand':48,49 'time':202 'tongu':42,97 'treasur':76,132,252 'vein':149 'wealth':151 'welcom':74 'wherewith':17 'wide':232 'womb':209 'world':156,220,257 'ye':23,29,75 'year':50 'yellow':125 'yet':279

667	Sourdough Mountain Lookout	185		\nI always say I won't go back to the mountains I am too old and fat there are bugs mean mules And pancakes every morning of the world Mr. Edward Wyman (63) Steams along the trail ahead of us all Moaning, "My poor feet ache, my back Is tired and I've got a stiff prick" Uprooting alder shoots in the rain Then I'm alone in a glass house on a ridge Encircled by chiming mountains With one sun roaring through the house all day & the others crashing through the glass all night Conscious even while sleeping     Morning fog in the southern gorge     Gleaming foam restoring the old sea-level     The lakes in two lights green soap and indigo     The high cirque-lake black half-open eye Ptarmigan hunt for bugs in the snow Bear peers through the wall at noon Deer crowd up to see the lamp A mouse nearly drowns in the honey I see my bootprints mingle with deer-foot Bear-paw mule-shoe in the dusty path to the privy Much later I write down:     "raging. Viking sunrise     The gorgeous death of summer in the east!" (Influence of a Byronic landscape— Bent pages exhibiting depravity of style.) Outside the lookout I lay nude on the granite Mountain hot September sun but inside my head Calm dark night with all the other stars HERACLITUS: "The waking have one common world But the sleeping turn aside Each into a world of his own." I keep telling myself what I really like Are music, books, certain land and sea-scapes The way light falls across them, diffusion of Light through agate, light itself . . . I suppose I'm still afraid of the dark     "Remember smart-guy there's something     Bigger something smarter than you."     Ireland's fear of unknown holies drives     My father's voice (a country neither he     Nor his great-grandfather ever saw)     A sparkly tomb a plated grave     A holy thumb beneath a wave Everything else they hauled across Atlantic Scattered and lost in the buffalo plains Among these trees and mountains From Duns Scotus to this page A thousand years     (". . . a dog walking on this hind legs—     not that he does it well but that he       does it at all.") Virtually a blank except for the hypothesis That there is more to a man Than the contents of his jock-strap EMPEDOCLES: "At one time all the limbs Which are the body's portion are brought together By Love in blooming life's high season; at another Severed by cruel Strife, they wander each alone By the breakers of life's sea." Fire and pressure from the sun bear down Bear down centipede shadow of palm-frond A limestone lithograph—oysters and clams of stone Half a black rock bomb displaying brilliant crystals Fire and pressure Love and Strife bear down Brontosaurus, look away My sweat runs down the rock HERACLITUS: "The transformations of fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind. . . . It scatters and it gathers; it advances and retires." I move out of a sweaty pool        (The sea!) And sit up higher on the rock Is anything burning? The sun itself! Dying Pooping out, exhausted Having produced brontosaurus, Heraclitus This rock, me, To no purpose I tell you anyway (as a kind of loving) . . . Flies & other insects come from miles around To listen I also address the rock, the heather, The alpine fir BUDDHA: "All the constituents of being are Transitory: Work out your salvation with diligence." (And everything, as one eminent disciple of that master Pointed out, had been tediously complex ever since.) There was a bird Lived in an egg And by ingenious chemistry Wrought molecules of albumen To beak and eye Gizzard and craw Feather and claw My grandmother said: "Look at them poor bed- raggled pigeons!" And the sign in McAlister Street:             "IF YOU CAN'T COME IN             SMILE AS YOU GO BY                    LOVE                THE BUTCHER I destroy myself, the universe (an egg) And time—to get an answer: There are a smiler, a sleeper and a dancer We repeat the conversation in the glittering dark Floating beside the sleeper. The child remarks, "You knew it all the time." I: "I keep forgetting that the smiler is Sleeping; the sleeper, dancing." From Sauk Lookout two years before Some of the view was down the Skagit To Puget Sound: From above the lower ranges, Deep in the forest—lighthouses on clear nights. This year's rock is a spur from the main range Cuts the valley in two and is broken By the river; Ross Dam repairs the break, Makes trolley buses run Through the streets of dim Seattle far away. I'm surrounded by mountains here A circle of 108 beads, originally seeds     of ficus religiosa           Bo-Tree A circle, continuous, one odd bead Larger than the rest and bearing A tassel (hair-tuft) (the man who sat              under the tree) In the center of the circle, a void, an empty figure containing All that's multiplied; Each bead a repetition, a world Of ignorance and sleep. Today is the day the goose gets cooked Day of liberation for the crumbling flower Knobcone pinecone in the flames Brandy in the sun Which, as I said, will disappear Anyway it'll be invisible soon Exchanging places with stars now in my head To be growing rice in China through the night. Magnetic storms across the solar plains Make Aurora Borealis shimmy bright Beyond the mountains to the north. Closing the lookout in the morning Thick ice on the shutters Coyote almost whistling on a nearby ridge The mountain is THERE (between two lakes) I brought back a piece of its rock Heavy dark-honey color With a seam of crystal, some of the quartz Stained by its matrix Practically indestructible A shift from opacity to brilliance (The Zenbos say, "Lightening-flash & flint-spark") Like the mountains where it was made What we see of the world is the mind's Invention and the mind Though stained by it, becoming Rivers, sun, mule-dung, flies— Can shift instantly A dirty bird in a square time Gone Gone REALLY gone Into the cool O MAMA! Like they say, "Four times up, Three times down." I'm still on the mountain.\n	'108':813 '63':36 'ach':49 'across':278,346,928 'address':585 'advanc':526 'afraid':292 'agat':284 'ahead':41 'albumen':639 'alder':62 'almost':955 'alon':70,444

648	Shadows in the Water	272		\nIn unexperienced infancy Many a sweet mistake doth lie: Mistake though false, intending true; A seeming somewhat more than view;          That doth instruct the mind          In things that lie behind, And many secrets to us show Which afterwards we come to know. Thus did I by the water’s brink Another world beneath me think; And while the lofty spacious skies Reversèd there, abused mine eyes,          I fancied other feet          Came mine to touch or meet; As by some puddle I did play Another world within it lay. Beneath the water people drowned, Yet with another heaven crowned, In spacious regions seemed to go As freely moving to and fro:          In bright and open space          I saw their very face; Eyes, hands, and feet they had like mine; Another sun did with them shine. ’Twas strange that people there should walk, And yet I could not hear them talk; That through a little watery chink, Which one dry ox or horse might drink,          We other worlds should see,          Yet not admitted be; And other confines there behold Of light and darkness, heat and cold. I called them oft, but called in vain; No speeches we could entertain: Yet did I there expect to find Some other world, to please my mind.          I plainly saw by these          A new antipodes, Whom, though they were so plainly seen, A film kept off that stood between. By walking men’s reversèd feet I chanced another world to meet; Though it did not to view exceed A phantom, ’tis a world indeed,          Where skies beneath us shine,          And earth by art divine Another face presents below, Where people’s feet against ours go. Within the regions of the air, Compassed about with heavens fair, Great tracts of land there may be found Enriched with fields and fertile ground;          Where many numerous hosts          In those far distant coasts, For other great and glorious ends Inhabit, my yet unknown friends. O ye that stand upon the brink, Whom I so near me through the chink With wonder see: what faces there, Whose feet, whose bodies, do ye wear?          I my companions see          In you, another me. They seemèd others, but are we; Our second selves these shadows be. Look how far off those lower skies Extend themselves! scarce with mine eyes I can them reach. O ye my friends, What secret borders on those ends?          Are lofty heavens hurled ’Bout your inferior world? Are yet the representatives Of other peoples’ distant lives? Of all the playmates which I knew That here I do the image view In other selves, what can it mean? But that below the purling stream          Some unknown joys there be          Laid up in store for me; To which I shall, when that thin skin Is broken, be admitted in.\n	'abus':68 'admit':175,470 'afterward':42 'air':289 'anoth':55,88,100,133,246,273,363 'antipod':223 'art':271 'behind':34 'behold':181 'beneath':57,93,265 'bodi':353 'border':400 'bout':408 'bright':116 'brink':54,335 'broken':468 'call':190,194 'came':75 'chanc':245 'chink':159,343 'coast':317 'cold':188 'come':44 'companion':359 'compass':290 'confin':179 'could':149,200 'crown':102 'dark':185 'distant':316,419 'divin':272 'doth':12,26 'dri':162 'drink':167 'drown':97 'earth':269 'end':323,403 'enrich':303 'entertain':201 'exceed':256 'expect':206 'extend':384 'eye':70,125,389 'face':124,274,348 'fair':294 'fals':16 'fanci':72 'far':315,379 'feet':74,128,243,280,351 'fertil':307 'field':305 'film':232 'find':208 'found':302 'freeli':110 'friend':328,397 'fro':114 'glorious':322 'go':108,283 'great':295,320 'ground':308 'hand':126 'hear':151 'heat':186 'heaven':101,293,406 'hors':165 'host':312 'hurl':407 'imag':433 'inde':262 'infanc':7 'inferior':410 'inhabit':324 'instruct':27 'intend':17 'joy':450 'kept':233 'knew':427 'know':46 'laid':453 'land':298 'lay':92 'lie':13,33 'light':183 'like':131 'littl':157 'live':420 'lofti':63,405 'look':377 'lower':382 'mani':8,36,310 'may':300 'mean':441 'meet':80,249 'men':240 'might':166 'mind':29,215 'mine':69,76,132,388 'mistak':11,14 'move':111 'near':339 'new':222 'numer':311 'o':329,394 'oft':192 'one':161 'open':118 'other':367 'ox':163 'peopl':96,142,278,418 'phantom':258 'plain':217,229 'play':87 'playmat':424 'pleas':213 'present':275 'puddl':84 'purl':446 'reach':393 'region':105,286 'repres':415 'reversèd':66,242 'saw':121,218 'scarc':386 'second':372 'secret':37,399 'see':172,346,360 'seem':20,106 'seemèd':366 'seen':230 'selv':373,437 'shadow':1,375 'shall':462 'shine':138,267 'show':40 'skin':466 'sky':65,264,383 'somewhat':21 'space':119 'spacious':64,104 'speech':198 'stand':332 'stood':236 'store':456 'strang':140 'stream':447 'sun':134 'sweet':10 'talk':153 'thin':465 'thing':31 'think':59 'though':15,225,250 'thus':47 'tis':259 'touch':78 'tract':296 'true':18 'twas':139 'unexperienc':6 'unknown':327,449 'upon':333 'us':39,266 'vain':196 'view':24,255,434 'walk':145,239 'water':4,52,95 'wateri':158 'wear':356 'whose':350,352 'within':90,284 'wonder':345 'world':56,89,170,211,247,261,411 'ye':330,355,395 'yet':98,147,173,202,326,413
649	On the Death of the Late Earl of Rochester	222		\nMourn, mourn, ye Muses, all your loss deplore, The young, the noble Strephon is no more. Yes, yes, he fled quick as departing light, And ne’er shall rise from Death’s eternal night, So rich a prize the Stygian gods ne’er bore, Such wit, such beauty, never graced their shore. He was but lent this duller world t’ improve In all the charms of poetry, and love; Both were his gift, which freely he bestowed, And like a god, dealt to the wond’ring crowd. Scorning the little vanity of fame, Spight of himself attained a glorious name. But oh! in vain was all his peevish pride, The sun as soon might his vast luster hide, As piercing, pointed, and more lasting bright, As suffering no vicissitudes of night.    Mourn, mourn, ye Muses, all your loss deplore,    The young, the noble Strephon is no more. Now uninspired upon your banks we lie, Unless when we would mourn his elegy; His name’s a genius that would wit dispense, And give the theme a soul, the words a sense. But all fine thought that ravisht when it spoke, With the soft youth eternal leave has took; Uncommon wit that did the soul o’ercome, Is buried all in Strephon’s worshipped tomb; Satire has lost its art, its sting is gone, The Fop and Cully now may be undone; That dear instructing rage is now allayed, And no sharp pen dares tell ’em how they’ve strayed; Bold as a god was ev’ry lash he took, But kind and gentle the chastizing stroke.     Mourn, mourn, ye youths, whom fortune has betrayed,     The last reproacher of your vice is dead. Mourn, all ye beauties, put your Cyprus on, The truest swain that e’re adored you’s gone; Think how he loved, and writ, and sighed, and spoke, Recall his mien, his fashion, and his look. By what dear arts the soul he did surprise, Soft as his voice, and charming as his eyes. Bring garlands all of never-dying flowers, Bedewed with everlasting falling showers; Fix your fair eyes upon your victimed slave, Sent gay and young to his untimely grave. See where the noble swain extended lies, Too sad a triumph of your victories; Adorned with all the graces Heaven e’er lent, All that was great, soft, lovely, excellent You’ve laid into his early monument.     Mourn, mourn, ye beauties, your sad loss deplore,     The young, the charming Strephon is no more. Mourn, all ye little gods of love, whose darts Have lost their wonted power of piercing hearts; Lay by the gilded quiver and the bow, The useless toys can do no mischief now, Those eyes that all your arrows’ points inspired, Those lights that gave ye fire are now retired, Cold as his tomb, pale as your mother’s doves; Bewail him then oh all ye little loves, For you the humblest votary have lost That ever your divinities could boast; Upon your hands your weeping heads decline, And let your wings encompass round his shrine; In stead of flowers your broken arrows strow, And at his feet lay the neglected bow.          Mourn, all ye little gods, your loss deplore,          The soft, the charming Strephon is no more. Large was his fame, but short his glorious race, Like young Lucretius lived and died apace. So early roses fade, so over all They cast their fragrant scents, then softly fall, While all the scattered perfumed leaves declare, How lovely ’twas when whole, how sweet, how fair. Had he been to the Roman Empire known, When great Augustus filled the peaceful throne; Had he the noble wond’rous poet seen, And known his genius, and surveyed his mien, (When wits, and heroes graced divine abodes), He had increased the number of their gods; The royal judge had temples rear’d to’s name, And made him as immortal as his fame; In love and verse his Ovid he’ad out-done, And all his laurels, and his Julia won.     Mourn, mourn, unhappy world, his loss deplore,     The great, the charming Strephon is no more.\n	'abod':639 'ad':673 'ador':305 'adorn':388 'allay':246 'apac':570 'arrow':465,529 'art':227,330 'attain':106 'augustus':612 'bank':161 'beauti':57,294,414 'bedew':353 'bestow':86 'betray':282 'bewail':487 'boast':507 'bold':258 'bore':53 'bow':451,538 'bright':134 'bring':345 'broken':528 'buri':216 'cast':579 'charm':74,341,422,550,695 'chastiz':273 'cold':477 'could':506 'crowd':96 'culli':235 'cyprus':297 'd':654 'dare':251 'dart':435 'dead':290 'dealt':91 'dear':241,329 'death':3,40 'declar':592 'declin':514 'depart':32 'deplor':17,148,418,546,691 'die':351,569 'dispens':179 'divin':505,638 'done':676 'dove':486 'duller':67 'e':303,394 'earl':7 'earli':409,572 'elegi':170 'em':253 'empir':608 'encompass':519 'er':36,52,395 'ercom':214 'etern':42,203 'ev':263 'ever':503 'everlast':355 'excel':403 'extend':379 'eye':344,361,461 'fade':574 'fair':360,601 'fall':356,585 'fame':102,558,665 'fashion':323 'feet':534 'fill':613 'fine':192 'fire':473 'fix':358 'fled':29 'flower':352,526 'fop':233 'fortun':280 'fragrant':581 'freeli':84 'garland':346 'gave':471 'gay':367 'genius':175,628 'gentl':271 'gift':82 'gild':447 'give':181 'glorious':108,562 'god':50,90,261,431,543,647 'gone':231,308 'grace':59,392,637 'grave':373 'great':400,611,693 'hand':510 'head':513 'heart':443 'heaven':393 'hero':636 'hide':127 'humblest':498 'immort':662 'improv':70 'increas':642 'inspir':467 'instruct':242 'judg':650 'julia':683 'kind':269 'known':609,626 'laid':406 'larg':555 'lash':265 'last':133,284 'late':6 'laurel':680 'lay':444,535 'leav':204,591 'lent':65,396 'let':516 'lie':163,380 'light':33,469 'like':88,564 'littl':99,430,493,542 'live':567 'look':326 'loss':16,147,417,545,690 'lost':225,437,501 'love':78,312,402,433,494,594,667 'lucretius':566 'luster':126 'made':659 'may':237 'mien':321,632 'might':123 'mischief':458 'monument':410 'mother':484 'mourn':10,11,141,142,168,275,276,291,411,412,427,539,685,686 'muse':13,144 'name':109,172,657 'ne':35,51 'neglect':537 'never':58,350 'never-di':349 'night':43,140 'nobl':21,152,377,620 'number':644 'o':213 'oh':111,490 'out-don':674 'ovid':671 'pale':481 'peac':615 'peevish':117 'pen':250 'perfum':590 'pierc':129,442 'poet':623 'poetri':76 'point':130,466 'power':440 'pride':118 'prize':47 'put':295 'quick':30 'quiver':448 'race':563 'rage':243 'ravisht':195 're':304 'rear':653 'recal':319 'reproach':285 'retir':476 'rich':45 'ring':95 'rise':38 'rochest':9 'roman':607 'rose':573 'round':520 'rous':622 'royal':649 'ry':264 'sad':382,416 'satir':223 'scatter':589 'scent':582 'scorn':97 'see':374 'seen':624 'sens':189 'sent':366 'shall':37 'sharp':249 'shore':61 'short':560 'shower':357 'shrine':522 'sigh':316 'slave':365 'soft':201,336,401,548,584 'soon':122 'soul':185,212,332 'spight':103 'spoke':198,318 'stead':524 'sting':229 'stray':257 'strephon':22,153,219,423,551,696 'stroke':274 'strow':530 'stygian':49 'suffer':136 'sun':120 'surpris':335 'survey':630 'swain':301,378 'sweet':599 'tell':252 'templ':652 'theme':183 'think':309 'thought':193 'throne':616 'tomb':222,480 'took':206,267 'toy':454 'triumph':384 'truest':300 'twas':595 'uncommon':207 'undon':239 'unhappi':687 'uninspir':158 'unless':164 'untim':372 'upon':159,362,508 'useless':453 'vain':113 'vaniti':100 'vast':125 've':256,405 'vers':669 'vice':288 'vicissitud':138 'victim':364 'victori':387 'voic':339 'votari':499 'weep':512 'whole':597 'whose':434 'wing':518 'wit':55,178,208,634 'won':684 'wond':94,621 'wont':439 'word':187 'world':68,688 'worship':221 'would':167,177 'writ':314 'ye':12,143,277,293,413,429,472,492,541 'yes':26,27 'young':19,150,369,420,565 'youth':202,278

The untamed heart to hand I brought, And fixed the wild and wandering thought. I never vowed nor sighed in vain    But both, though false, were well received. The fair are pleased to give us pain,    And what they wish is soon believed. And though I talked of wounds and smart, Love’s pleasures only touched my heart. Alone the glory and the spoil    I always laughing bore away; The triumphs, without pain or toil,    Without the hell, the heav’n of joy. And while I thus at random rove Despise the fools that whine for love.\n	'alon':83 'alway':90 'away':93 'beauti':17 'believ':67 'betray':19 'bore':92 'brought':31 'desir':14 'despis':115 'fair':54 'fals':49 'fire':24 'fix':33 'fool':117 'give':58 'glori':85 'hand':29 'heart':27,82 'heav':104 'hell':102 'joy':107 'languish':21 'laugh':91 'love':76,121 'made':9 'martyr':3,6 'n':105 'never':40 'pain':60,97 'pleas':56 'pleasur':78 'random':113 'receiv':52 'resistless':23 'rove':114 'sacrif':11 'sigh':43 'smart':75 'soon':66 'spoil':88 'talk':71 'though':48,69 'thought':38 'thousand':2,5,16 'thus':111 'toil':99 'touch':80 'triumph':95 'untam':26 'us':59 'vain':45 'vow':41 'wander':37 'well':51 'whine':119 'wild':35 'wish':64 'without':96,100 'wound':73
651	The Disabled Debauchee	273		\nAs some brave admiral, in former war    Deprived of force, but pressed with courage still, Two rival fleets appearing from afar,    Crawls to the top of an adjacent hill; From whence, with thoughts full of concern, he views    The wise and daring conduct of the fight, Whilst each bold action to his mind renews    His present glory and his past delight; From his fierce eyes flashes of fire he throws,    As from black clouds when lightning breaks away; Transported, thinks himself amidst the foes,    And absent, yet enjoys the bloody day; So, when my days of impotence approach,    And I’m by pox and wine’s unlucky chance Forced from the pleasing billows of debauch    On the dull shore of lazy temperance, My pains at least some respite shall afford    While I behold the battles you maintain When fleets of glasses sail about the board,    From whose broadsides volleys of wit shall rain. Nor let the sight of honorable scars,    Which my too forward valor did procure, Frighten new-listed soldiers from the wars:    Past joys have more than paid what I endure. Should any youth (worth being drunk) prove nice,    And from his fair inviter meanly shrink, ’Twill please the ghost of my departed vice    If, at my counsel, he repent and drink. Or should some cold-complexioned sot forbid,    With his dull morals, our bold night-alarms, I’ll fire his blood by telling what I did    When I was strong and able to bear arms. I’ll tell of whores attacked, their lords at home;    Bawds’ quarters beaten up, and fortress won; Windows demolished, watches overcome;    And handsome ills by my contrivance done. Nor shall our love-fits, Chloris, be forgot,    When each the well-looked linkboy strove t’ enjoy, And the best kiss was the deciding lot    Whether the boy fucked you, or I the boy. With tales like these I will such thoughts inspire    As to important mischief shall incline: I’ll make him long some ancient church to fire,    And fear no lewdness he’s called to by wine. Thus, statesmanlike, I’ll saucily impose,    And safe from action, valiantly advise; Sheltered in impotence, urge you to blows,    And being good for nothing else, be wise.\n	'abl':251 'absent':89 'action':53,363 'adjac':31 'admir':7 'advis':365 'afar':24 'afford':133 'alarm':235 'amidst':85 'ancient':340 'appear':22 'approach':101 'arm':254 'attack':260 'away':81 'battl':138 'bawd':265 'bear':253 'beaten':267 'behold':136 'best':304 'billow':116 'black':76 'blood':240 'bloodi':93 'blow':372 'board':148 'bold':52,232 'boy':312,318 'brave':6 'break':80 'broadsid':151 'call':350 'chanc':111 'chlori':289 'church':341 'cloud':77 'cold':223 'cold-complexion':222 'complexion':224 'concern':39 'conduct':46 'contriv':281 'counsel':214 'courag':17 'crawl':25 'dare':45 'day':94,98 'debauch':118 'debauche':3 'decid':308 'delight':64 'demolish':273 'depart':209 'depriv':11 'disabl':2 'done':282 'drink':218 'drunk':193 'dull':121,229 'els':378 'endur':187 'enjoy':91,301 'eye':68 'fair':199 'fear':345 'fierc':67 'fight':49 'fire':71,238,343 'fit':288 'flash':69 'fleet':21,142 'foe':87 'forbid':226 'forc':13,112 'forgot':291 'former':9 'fortress':270 'forward':167 'frighten':171 'fuck':313 'full':37 'ghost':206 'glass':144 'glori':60 'good':375 'handsom':277 'hill':32 'home':264 'honor':162 'ill':278 'import':330 'impos':359 'impot':100,368 'inclin':333 'inspir':327 'invit':200 'joy':180 'kiss':305 'lazi':124 'least':129 'let':158 'lewd':347 'lightn':79 'like':321 'linkboy':298 'list':174 'll':237,256,335,357 'long':338 'look':297 'lord':262 'lot':309 'love':287 'love-fit':286 'm':104 'maintain':140 'make':336 'mean':201 'mind':56 'mischief':331 'moral':230 'new':173 'new-list':172 'nice':195 'night':234 'night-alarm':233 'noth':377 'overcom':275 'paid':184 'pain':127 'past':63,179 'pleas':115,204 'pox':106 'present':59 'press':15 'procur':170 'prove':194 'quarter':266 'rain':156 'renew':57 'repent':216 'respit':131 'rival':20 'safe':361 'sail':145 'saucili':358 'scar':163 'shall':132,155,284,332 'shelter':366 'shore':122 'shrink':202 'sight':160 'soldier':175 'sot':225 'statesmanlik':355 'still':18 'strong':249 'strove':299 'tale':320 'tell':242,257 'temper':125 'think':83 'thought':36,326 'throw':73 'thus':354 'top':28 'transport':82 'twill':203 'two':19 'unlucki':110 'urg':369 'valiant':364 'valor':168 'vice':210 'view':41 'volley':152 'war':10,178 'watch':274 'well':296 'well-look':295 'whenc':34 'whether':310 'whilst':50 'whore':259 'whose':150 'window':272 'wine':108,353 'wise':43,380 'wit':154 'won':271 'worth':191 'yet':90 'youth':190
652	The Imperfect Enjoyment	273		\nNaked she lay, clasped in my longing arms, I filled with love, and she all over charms; Both equally inspired with eager fire, Melting through kindness, flaming in desire. With arms, legs, lips close clinging to embrace, She clips me to her breast, and sucks me to her face. Her nimble tongue, love’s lesser lightning, played Within my mouth, and to my thoughts conveyed Swift orders that I should prepare to throw The all-dissolving thunderbolt below. My fluttering soul, sprung with the pointed kiss, Hangs hovering o’er her balmy brinks of bliss. But whilst her busy hand would guide that part Which should convey my soul up to her heart, In liquid raptures I dissolve all o’er, Melt into sperm, and spend at every pore. A touch from any part of her had done ’t: Her hand, her foot, her very look's a cunt.    Smiling, she chides in a kind murmuring noise, And from her body wipes the clammy joys, When, with a thousand kisses wandering o’er My panting bosom, “Is there then no more?” She cries. “All this to love and rapture’s due; Must we not pay a debt to pleasure too?”     But I, the most forlorn, lost man alive, To show my wished obedience vainly strive: I sigh, alas! and kiss, but cannot swive. Eager desires confound my first intent, Succeeding shame does more success prevent, And rage at last confirms me impotent. Ev’n her fair hand, which might bid heat return To frozen age, and make cold hermits burn, Applied to my dear cinder, warms no more Than fire to ashes could past flames restore. Trembling, confused, despairing, limber, dry, A wishing, weak, unmoving lump I lie. This dart of love, whose piercing point, oft tried, With virgin blood ten thousand maids has dyed, Which nature still directed with such art That it through every cunt reached every heart— Stiffly resolved, ’twould carelessly invade Woman or man, nor ought its fury stayed: Where’er it pierced, a cunt it found or made— Now languid lies in this unhappy hour, Shrunk up and sapless like a withered flower.     Thou treacherous, base deserter of my flame, False to my passion, fatal to my fame, Through what mistaken magic dost thou prove So true to lewdness, so untrue to love? What oyster-cinder-beggar-common whore Didst thou e’er fail in all thy life before? When vice, disease, and scandal lead the way, With what officious haste doest thou obey! Like a rude, roaring hector in the streets Who scuffles, cuffs, and justles all he meets, But if his king or country claim his aid, The rakehell villain shrinks and hides his head; Ev’n so thy brutal valor is displayed, Breaks every stew, does each small whore invade, But when great Love the onset does command, Base recreant to thy prince, thou dar’st not stand. Worst part of me, and henceforth hated most, Through all the town a common fucking post, On whom each whore relieves her tingling cunt As hogs on gates do rub themselves and grunt, Mayst thou to ravenous chancres be a prey, Or in consuming weepings waste away; May strangury and stone thy days attend; May’st thou never piss, who didst refuse to spend When all my joys did on false thee depend.    And may ten thousand abler pricks agree    To do the wronged Corinna right for thee.\n	'abler':569 'age':259 'agre':571 'aid':449 'ala':222 'aliv':212 'all-dissolv':78 'appli':265 'arm':11,34 'art':316 'ash':276 'attend':545 'away':538 'balmi':96 'base':365,482 'beggar':397 'bid':254 'bliss':99 'blood':304 'bodi':165 'bosom':180 'break':466 'breast':46 'brink':97 'brutal':462 'burn':264 'busi':103 'cannot':226 'careless':328 'chancr':529 'charm':20 'chide':156 'cinder':269,396 'claim':447 'clammi':168 'clasp':7 'cling':38 'clip':42 'close':37 'cold':262 'command':481 'common':398,505 'confirm':244 'confound':230 'confus':282 'consum':535 'convey':68,111 'corinna':576 'could':277 'countri':446 'cri':187 'cuff':435 'cunt':153,321,343,515 'dar':488 'dart':294 'day':544 'dear':268 'debt':201 'depend':564 'desert':366 'desir':32,229 'despair':283 'didst':400,552 'direct':313 'diseas':412 'display':465 'dissolv':80,122 'doest':422 'done':142 'dost':382 'dri':285 'due':195 'dy':309 'e':402 'eager':25,228 'embrac':40 'enjoy':3 'equal':22 'er':94,125,177,339,403 'ev':247,458 'everi':132,320,323,467 'face':52 'fail':404 'fair':250 'fals':370,562 'fame':377 'fatal':374 'fill':13 'fire':26,274 'first':232 'flame':30,279,369 'flower':362 'flutter':84 'foot':147 'forlorn':209 'found':345 'frozen':258 'fuck':506 'furi':336 'gate':519 'great':476 'grunt':524 'guid':106 'hand':104,145,251 'hang':91 'hast':421 'hate':498 'head':457 'heart':117,324 'heat':255 'hector':429 'henceforth':497 'hermit':263 'hide':455 'hog':517 'hour':354 'hover':92 'imperfect':2 'impot':246 'inspir':23 'intent':233 'invad':329,473 'joy':169,559 'justl':437 'kind':29,159 'king':444 'kiss':90,174,224 'languid':349 'last':243 'lay':6 'lead':415 'leg':35 'lesser':58 'lewd':388 'lie':292,350 'life':408 'lightn':59 'like':359,425 'limber':284 'lip':36 'liquid':119 'long':10 'look':150 'lost':210 'love':15,56,191,296,392,477 'lump':290 'made':347 'magic':381 'maid':307 'make':261 'man':211,332 'may':539,546,566 'mayst':525 'meet':440 'melt':27,126 'might':253 'mistaken':380 'mouth':63 'murmur':160 'must':196 'n':248,459 'nake':4 'natur':311 'never':549 'nimbl':54 'nois':161 'o':93,124,176 'obedi':217 'obey':424 'offici':420 'oft':300 'onset':479 'order':70 'ought':334 'oyster':395 'oyster-cinder-beggar-common':394 'pant':179 'part':108,138,493 'passion':373 'past':278 'pay':199 'pierc':298,341 'piss':550 'play':60 'pleasur':203 'point':89,299 'pore':133 'post':507 'prepar':74 'prevent':239 'prey':532 'prick':570 'princ':486 'prove':384 'rage':241 'rakehel':451 'raptur':120,193 'raven':528 'reach':322 'recreant':483 'refus':553 'reliev':512 'resolv':326 'restor':280 'return':256 'right':577 'roar':428 'rub':521 'rude':427 'sapless':358 'scandal':414 'scuffl':434 'shame':235 'show':214 'shrink':453 'shrunk':355 'sigh':221 'small':471 'smile':154 'soul':85,113 'spend':130,555 'sperm':128 'sprung':86 'st':489,547 'stand':491 'stay':337 'stew':468 'stiffli':325 'still':312 'stone':542 'stranguri':540 'street':432 'strive':219 'succeed':234 'success':238 'suck':48 'swift':69 'swive':227 'ten':305,567 'thee':563,579 'thi':407,461,485,543 'thou':363,383,401,423,487,526,548 'thought':67 'thousand':173,306,568 'throw':76 'thunderbolt':81 'tingl':514 'tongu':55 'touch':135 'town':503 'treacher':364 'trembl':281 'tri':301 'true':386 'twould':327 'unhappi':353 'unmov':289 'untru':390 'vain':218 'valor':463 'vice':411 'villain':452 'virgin':303 'wander':175 'warm':270 'wast':537 'way':417 'weak':288 'weep':536 'whilst':101 'whore':399,472,511 'whose':297 'wipe':166 'wish':216,287 'wither':361 'within':61 'woman':330 'worst':492 'would':105 'wrong':575

668	Before Parting	207		\nA month or twain to live on honeycomb    Is pleasant; but one tires of scented time,    Cold sweet recurrence of accepted rhyme, And that strong purple under juice and foam Where the wine’s heart has burst; Nor feel the latter kisses like the first. Once yet, this poor one time; I will not pray    Even to change the bitterness of it,     The bitter taste ensuing on the sweet, To make your tears fall where your soft hair lay All blurred and heavy in some perfumed wise Over my face and eyes. And yet who knows what end the scythèd wheat    Makes of its foolish poppies’ mouths of red?    These were not sown, these are not harvested, They grow a month and are cast under feet  And none has care thereof, As none has care of divided love. I know each shadow of your lips by rote,    Each change of love in eyelids and eyebrows;    The fashion of fair temples tremulous With tender blood, and colour of your throat; I know not how love is gone out of this, Seeing that all was his. Love’s likeness there endures upon all these:    But out of these one shall not gather love.    Day hath not strength nor the night shade enough To make love whole and fill his lips with ease, As some bee-builded cell Feels at filled lips the heavy honey swell. I know not how this last month leaves your hair    Less full of purple colour and hid spice,    And that luxurious trouble of closed eyes Is mixed with meaner shadows and waste care; And love, kissed out by pleasure, seems not yet Worth patience to regret.  \n	'accept':23 'bee':226 'bee-build':225 'bitter':62,66 'blood':166 'blur':83 'build':227 'burst':39 'care':132,137,269 'cast':126 'cell':228 'chang':60,151 'close':260 'cold':19 'colour':168,251 'day':204 'divid':139 'eas':222 'end':100 'endur':191 'enough':212 'ensu':68 'even':58 'eye':94,261 'eyebrow':157 'eyelid':155 'face':92 'fair':161 'fall':76 'fashion':159 'feel':41,229 'feet':128 'fill':218,231 'first':47 'foam':32 'foolish':107 'full':248 'gather':202 'gone':178 'grow':121 'hair':80,246 'harvest':119 'hath':205 'heart':37 'heavi':85,234 'hid':253 'honey':235 'honeycomb':10 'juic':30 'kiss':44,272 'know':98,142,173,238 'last':242 'latter':43 'lay':81 'leav':244 'less':247 'like':45,189 'lip':147,220,232 'live':8 'love':140,153,176,187,203,215,271 'luxuri':257 'make':73,104,214 'meaner':265 'mix':263 'month':4,123,243 'mouth':109 'night':210 'none':130,135 'one':14,52,199 'part':2 'patienc':280 'perfum':88 'pleasant':12 'pleasur':275 'poor':51 'poppi':108 'pray':57 'purpl':28,250 'recurr':21 'red':111 'regret':282 'rhyme':24 'rote':149 'scent':17 'scythèd':102 'see':182 'seem':276 'shade':211 'shadow':144,266 'shall':200 'soft':79 'sown':115 'spice':254 'strength':207 'strong':27 'sweet':20,71 'swell':236 'tast':67 'tear':75 'templ':162 'tender':165 'thereof':133 'throat':171 'time':18,53 'tire':15 'tremul':163 'troubl':258 'twain':6 'upon':192 'wast':268 'wheat':103 'whole':216 'wine':35 'wise':89 'worth':279 'yet':49,96,278

670	"Either she was foul, or her attire was bad"	283		\nEither she was foul, or her attire was bad,\rOr she was not the wench I wished t’have had.\rIdly I lay with her, as if I loved not,\rAnd like a burden grieved the bed that moved not.\rYet though both of us performed our true intent,\rYet I could not cast anchor where I meant.\rShe on my neck her ivory arms did throw,\rHer arms far whiter than the Scythian snow.\rAnd eagerly she kissed me with her tongue,\rAnd under mine her wanton thigh she flung.\rYea, and she soothed me up and called me sir,\rAnd used all speech that might provoke and stir.\rYet, like as if cold hemlock I had drunk,\rIt mockèd me, hung down the head, and sunk.\rLike a dull cipher or rude block I lay,\rOr shade or body was I, who can say?\rWhat will my age do, age I cannot shun,\rWhen in my prime my force is spent and done?\rI blush, that being youthful, hot and lusty,\rI prove neither youth nor man, but old and rusty.\rPure rose she, like a nun to sacrifice,\rOr one that with her tender brother lies.\rYet boarded I the golden Chie twice,\rAnd Libas, and the white-cheeked Pitho thrice.\rCorinna craved it in a summer’s night,\rAnd nine sweet bouts we had before daylight.\rWhat, waste my limbs through some Thessalian charms?\rMay spells and drugs do silly souls such harm?\rWith virgin wax hath some imbaste my joints\rAnd pierced my liver with sharp needles’ points?\rCharms change corn to grass and make it die.\rBy charms are running spring and fountains dry.\rBy charms mast crops from oaks, from vines grapes fall,\rAnd fruit from trees when there’s no wind at all.\rWhy might not then my sinews be enchanted,\rAnd I grow faint, as with some spirit haunted?\rTo this add shame: shame to perform it quailed me\rAnd was the second cause why vigour failed me.\rMy idle thoughts delighted her no more\rThan did the robe or garment which she wore.\rYet might her touch make youthful Pylius fire\rAnd Tithon livelier than his years require.\rEven her I had, and she had me in vain;\rWhat might I crave more if I asked again?\rI think the great gods grieved they had bestowed\rThe benefit which lewdly I for-slowed.\rI wished to be received in. In I get me\rTo kiss. I kiss. To lie with her, she let me.\rWhy was I blessed? Why made king to refuse it?\rChuff-like had I not gold and could not use it?\rSo in a spring thrives he that told so much, \rAnd looks upon the fruits he cannot touch.\rHath any rose so from a fresh young maid,\rAs she might straight have gone to church and prayed?\rWell I believe she kissed not as she should,\rNor used the sleight and cunning which she could.\rHuge oaks, hard adamants might she have moved,\rAnd with sweet words cause deaf rocks to have loved.\rWorthy she was to move both gods and men,\rBut neither was I man, nor lived then.\rCan deaf ear take delight when Phaemius sings?\rOr Thamiras in curious painted things?\rWhat sweet thought is there but I had the same?\rAnd one gave place still as another came.\rYet, notwithstanding, like one dead it lay,\rDrooping more than a rose pulled yesterday.\rNow, when he should not jet, he bolts upright\rAnd craves his task, and seeks to be at fight.\rLie down with shame, and see thou stir no more,\rSeeing thou wouldst deceive me as before.\rThou cozenest me, by thee surprised am I, \rAnd bide sore loss with endless infamy.\rNay more, the wench did not disdain a whit\rTo take it in her hand and play with it.\rBut when she saw it would by no means stand,\rBut still drooped down, regarding not her hand,\r‘Why mockst thou me?’ she cried. ‘Or, being ill,\rWho bade thee lie down here against thy will?\rEither thou art witch, with blood of frogs new dead,\rOr jaded camest thou from some other bed.’\rWith that, her loose gown on, from me she cast her –\rIn skipping out her naked feet much graced her.\rAnd, lest her maid should know of this disgrace,\rTo cover it, spilt water on the place. \r\n	'adam':516 'add':331 'age':159,161 'anchor':64 'anoth':578 'arm':74,78 'art':702 'ask':396 'attir':7,16 'bad':9,18 'bade':692

672	The Geranium	285		\nIn the close covert of a grove\rBy nature formed for scenes of love,\rSaid Susan in a lucky hour:\r‘Observe yon sweet geranium flower.\rHow straight upon its stalk it stands,\rAnd tempts our violating hands,\rWhilst the soft bud, as yet unspread,\rHangs down its pale declining head.\rYet soon as it is ripe to blow,\rThe stems shall rise, the head shall glow.’\r‘Nature,’ said I, ‘my lovely Sue,\rTo all her followers lends a clue.\rHer simple laws themselves explain\rAs links of one continued chain;\rFor her the mysteries of creation\rAre but the works of generation.\rYon blushing, strong, triumphant flower\rIs in the crisis of its power:\rBut short, alas, its vigorous reign;\rHe sheds his seed, and drops again.\rThe bud that hangs in pale decay\rFeels not, as yet, the plastic ray.\rTomorrow’s sun shall bid him rise,\rThen, too, he sheds his seed, and dies.\rBut words, my love, are vain and weak; \rFor proof, let bright example speak.’\rThen straight before the wondering maid\rThe tree of life I gently laid.\r‘Observe, sweet Sue, his drooping head,\rHow pale, how languid, and how dead.\rYet let the sun of thy bright eyes\rShine but a moment, it shall rise.\rLet but the dew of thy soft hand\rRefresh the stem, it straight shall stand.\rAlready, see, it swells, it grows,\rIts head is redder than the rose,\rIts shriveled fruit, of dusky hue,\rNow glows—a present fit for Sue.\rThe balm of life each artery fills,\rAnd in o’erflowing drops distils.’\r‘Oh, me!’ cried Susan, ‘When is this?\rWhat strange tumultuous throbs of bliss!\rSure, never mortal till this hour\rFelt such emotion at a flower!\rOh, serpent, cunning to deceive,\rSure ’tis this tree that tempted Eve.\rThe crimson apples hang so fair\rAlas! what woman could forbear?’\r‘Well hast thou guessed, my love,’ I cried,\r‘It is the tree by which she died –\rThe tree which could alone content her.\rAll nature, Susan, seeks the centre.\rYet let us still poor Eve forgive,\rIt’s the tree by which we live.\rFor lovely women still it grows,\rAnd in the centre only blows.\rBut chief for thee it spreads its charms,\rFor paradise is in thy arms …’\rI ceased, for nature kindly here\rBegan to whisper in her ear,\rAnd lovely Sue lay softly panting\rWhile the geranium tree was planting,\r’Til in the heat of amorous strife\rShe burst the mellow tree of life.\r‘Oh, heaven!’ cried Susan with a sigh,\r‘The hour we taste – we surely die.\rStrange raptures seize my fainting frame,\rAnd all my body glows with flame.\rYet let me snatch one parting kiss\rTo tell my love I die with bliss –\rThat pleased thy Susan yields her breath;\rOh, who would live, if this be death?’\r\n	'ala':119,311 'alon':336 'alreadi':229 'amor':415 'appl':307 'arm':385 'arteri':260 'balm':256 'began':392 'bid':148 'bliss':280,465 'blow':60,371 'blush':106 'bodi':447 'breath':472 'bright':170,205 'bud':43,131 'burst':418 'ceas':387 'centr':344,369 'chain':92 'charm':379 'chief':373 'close':5 'clue':81 'content':337 'continu':91 'could':314,335 'covert':6 'creation':98 'cri':270,323,426 'crimson':306 'crisi':113 'cun':295 'dead':198 'death':480 'decay':136 'deceiv':297 'declin':51 'dew':217 'die':158,331,437,463 'distil':267 'droop':190 'drop':128,266 'duski':246 'ear':397 'emot':289 'erflow':265 'eve':304,350 'exampl':171 'explain':86 'eye':206 'faint':442 'fair':310 'feel':137 'felt':287 'fill':261 'fit':252 'flame':450 'flower':27,109,292 'follow':78 'forbear':315 'forgiv':351 'form':12 'frame':443 'fruit':244 'generat':104 'gentl':184 'geranium':2,26,406 'glow':68,249,448 'grove':9 'grow':234,365 'guess':319 'hand':39,221 'hang':47,133,308 'hast':317 'head':52,66,191,236 'heat':413 'heaven':425 'hour':22,286,432 'hue':247 'kind':390 'kiss':457 'laid':185 'languid':195 'law':84 'lay':401 'lend':79 'let':169,200,214,346,452 'life':182,258,423 'link':88 'live':359,476 'love':16,73,162,321,361,399,461 'lucki':21 'maid':178 'mellow':420 'moment':210 'mortal':283 'mysteri':96 'natur':11,69,340,389 'never':282 'o':264 'observ':23,186 'oh':268,293,424,473 'one':90,455 'pale':50,135,193 'pant':403 'paradis':381 'part':456 'plant':409 'plastic':142 'pleas':467 'poor':349 'power':116 'present':251 'proof':168 'raptur':439 'ray':143 'redder':238 'refresh':222 'reign':122 'ripe':58 'rise':64,150,213 'rose':241 'said':17,70 'scene':14 'see':230 'seed':126,156 'seek':342 'seiz':440 'serpent':294 'shall':63,67,147,212,227 'shed':124,154 'shine':207 'short':118 'shrivel':243 'sigh':430 'simpl':83 'snatch':454 'soft':42,220,402 'soon':54 'speak':172 'spread':377 'stalk':32 'stand':34,228 'stem':62,224 'still':348,363 'straight':29,174,226 'strang':276,438 'strife':416 'strong':107 'sue':74,188,254,400 'sun':146,202 'sure':281,298,436 'susan':18,271,341,427,469 'sweet':25,187 'swell':232 'tast':434 'tell':459 'tempt':36,303 'thee':375 'thi':204,219,384,468 'thou':318 'throb':278 'til':410 'till':284 'tis':299 'tomorrow':144 'tree':180,301,327,333,355,407,421 'triumphant':108 'tumultu':277 'unspread':46 'upon':30 'us':347 'vain':164 'vigor':121 'violat':38 'weak':166 'well':316 'whilst':40 'whisper':394 'woman':313 'women':362 'wonder':177 'word':160 'work':102 'would':475 'yet':45,53,140,199,345,451 'yield':470 'yon':24,105

676	from The Sleepers	211		\nI see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies of the sea, His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs, I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes, I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on the rocks.

688	Ode 44	291		\nLast night, as half asleep I dreaming lay,     Half naked came she in her little shift,          With tilted glass, and verses on her lips; Narcissus-eyes all shining for the fray,          Filled full of frolic to her wine-red lips,          Warm as a dewy rose, sudden she slips     Into my bed – just in her little shift. Said she, half naked, half asleep, half heard, With a soft sigh betwixt each lazy word, ‘Oh my old lover, do you sleep or wake!’ And instant I sat upright for her sake, And drank whatever wine she poured for me –  Wine of the tavern, or vintage it might be Of Heaven’s own vine: he surely were a churl Who refused wine poured out by such a girl, A double traitor he to wine and love. Go to, thou puritan! the gods above Ordained this wine for us, but not for thee; Drunkards we are by a divine decree, Yea, by the special privilege of heaven Foredoomed to drink and foreordained forgiven.  Ah! HAFIZ, you are not the only man     Who promised penitence and broke down after; For who can keep so hard a promise, man,      With wine and woman brimming o’er with laughter!

689	Ode 487	291		\nWith last night’s wine still singing in my head, I sought the tavern at the break of day, Though half the world was still asleep in bed; The harp and flute were up and in full swing, And a most pleasant morning sound made they; Already was the wine-cup on the wing. ‘Reason,’ said I, ‘’t is past the time to start, If you would reach your daily destination, The holy city of intoxication.’   So did I pack him off, and he depart With a stout flask for fellow-traveller. Left to myself, the tavern-wench I spied, And sought to win her love by speaking fair; Alas! she turned upon me, scornful-eyed, And mocked my foolish hopes of winning her. Said she, her arching eyebrows like a bow: ‘Thou mark for all the shafts of evil tongues! Thou shalt not round my middle clasp me so, Like my good girdle – not for all thy songs! – So long as thou in all created things Seest but thyself the centre and the end. Go spread thy dainty nets for other wings – Too high the Anca’s nest for thee, my friend.’ Then took I shelter from that stormy sea In the good ark of wine; yet, woe is me! Saki and comrade and minstrel all by turns, She is of maidens the compendium Who my poor heart in such a fashion spurns. Self, HAFIZ, self! That thou must overcome! Hearken the wisdom of the tavern-daughter! Vain little baggage – well, upon my word! Thou fairy figment made of clay and water, As busy with thy beauty as a bird. Well, HAFIZ, Life’s a riddle – give it up: There is no answer to it but this cup.   \n	'487':2 'ala':115 'alreadi':49 'anca':193 'answer':291 'arch':134 'ark':211 'asleep':28 'baggag':258 'beauti':275 'bed':30 'bird':278 'bow':138 'break':19 'busi':272 'centr':178 'citi':77 'clasp':154 'clay':268 'compendium':231 'comrad':220 'creat':172 'cup':54,296 'daili':73 'dainti':185 'daughter':255 'day':21 'depart':88 'destin':74 'end':181 'evil':146 'eye':122 'eyebrow':135 'fair':114 'fairi':264 'fashion':239 'fellow':95 'fellow-travel':94 'figment':265 'flask':92 'flute':34 'foolish':126 'friend':199 'full':39 'girdl':160 'give':285 'go':182 'good':159,210 'hafiz':242,280 'half':23 'harp':32 'head':12 'hearken':248 'heart':235 'high':191 'holi':76 'hope':127 'intox':79 'last':4 'left':97 'life':281 'like':136,157 'littl':257 'long':167 'love':111 'made':47,266 'maiden':229 'mark':140 'middl':153 'minstrel':222 'mock':124 'morn':45 'must':246 'nest':195 'net':186 'night':5 'ode':1 'overcom':247 'pack':83 'past':63 'pleasant':44 'poor':234 'reach':71 'reason':58 'riddl':284 'round':151 'said':59,131 'saki':218 'scorn':121 'scornful-ey':120 'sea':207 'seest':174 'self':241,243 'shaft':144 'shalt':149 'shelter':203 'sing':9 'song':165 'sought':14,107 'sound':46 'speak':113 'spi':105 'spread':183 'spurn':240 'start':67 'still':8,27 'stormi':206 'stout':91 'swing':40 'tavern':16,102,254 'tavern-daught':253 'tavern-wench':101 'thee':197 'thi':164,184,274 'thing':173 'thou':139,148,169,245,263 'though':22 'thyself':176 'time':65 'tongu':147 'took':201 'travel':96 'turn':117,225 'upon':118,260 'vain':256 'water':270 'well':259,279 'wench':103 'win':109,129 'wine':7,53,213 'wine-cup':52 'wing':57,189 'wisdom':250 'woe':215 'word':262 'world':25 'would':70 'yet':214

691	The Militance of a Photograph in the Passbook of a Bantu under Detention	292		\nThe wrinkles on the brown face  of the carrying case conform to the buttocks, on which the streaks of water  from a five-gallon can dribble on the tailfront of the borrowed shirt he would wear if he could drain the pus from his swaddling  bandages, striations of skin tunneling into the photograph. This is no simple mug shot of a runaway boy in a training  film, Soweto's pummeled wire,  though the turrets of light  glisten in smoke, the soft  coal hooding his platform  entrance, dull and quiet. His father's miner's shoes  stand in puddles of polish,  the black soot baked into images of brittle torso,  an inferno of bullets laid  out in a letter bomb, the frontispiece of one sergeant- major blackening his mustache. On the drive to Evaton a blank pass away from Sharpeville  where the freehold morgans were bought by a black bishop from Ontario, Canada, on a trek northward from the Cape in 1908, I speak to myself as the woman riding in the backseat talks of this day, her husband's death, twenty-three years ago, run over by an Afrikaner in the wrong  passing lane; the passbook on the shoulder  of the road leading to Evaton is not the one I have in my hand, and the photograph is not of my great- grandfather, who set sail for Philadelphia  in the war year of 1916. He did not want a reception, his letters  embarking on a platform at Queenstown  where his eloquence struck two Zulu warriors  pledged to die in the homelands because they could not spin their own gold. These threaded heads weigh down the ears  in design of the warrior, Shaka, indifferent to the ruthless offerings over the dead bodies of his wives, childless in the campaigns with the British,  who sit on the ships of the Indian Ocean  each kraal shuddering near the borders; her lips turn in profile to the dust rising over a road  where his house once stood;  one could think of the women  carrying firewood as an etching  in remembrance to the silence,  commencing at Sharpeville, but this is Evaton, where he would come from across the galleyship of spears  turning in his robes to a bookmark; it is a good book, the picture of words  in the gloss of a photograph, the burned image of the man who wears  this image on the tongue of a child,  who might hold my hand as we walk in late afternoon into the predestined sun. The press of wrinkles on the blanketed  voice of the man who took the train  from Johannesburg is flattened in Cape Town,  and the history of this book  is on a trestle where Gandhi  worshipped in Natal, and the Zulu lullaby I cannot sing in Bantu is this song in the body  of a passbook and the book passes into a shirt and the back that wears it.\n	'1908':175 '1916':249 'across':377 'afrikan':204 'afternoon':430 'ago':199 'away':151 'back':499 'backseat':186 'bake':118 'bandag':60 'bantu':11,480 'bishop':163 'black':116,162 'blacken':140 'blank':149 'blanket':441 'bodi':306,486 'bomb':133 'book':393,462,492 'bookmark':388 'border':331 'borrow':46 'bought':159 'boy':77 'british':316 'brittl':122 'brown':18 'bullet':127 'burn':405 'buttock':27 'campaign':313 'canada':166 'cannot':477 'cape':173,455 'carri':22,355 'case':23 'child':419 'childless':310 'coal':96 'come':375 'commenc':365 'conform':24 'could':53,279,350 'day':190 'dead':305 'death':194 'design':293 'detent':13 'die':273 'drain':54 'dribbl':40 'drive':145 'dull':101 'dust':339 'ear':291 'eloqu':266 'embark':258 'entranc':100 'etch':359 'evaton':147,220,371 'face':19 'father':105 'film':81 'firewood':356 'five':37 'five-gallon':36 'flatten':453 'freehold':156 'frontispiec':135 'galleyship':379 'gallon':38 'gandhi':468 'glisten':91 'gloss':400 'gold':284 'good':392 'grandfath':238 'great':237 'hand':229,424 'head':287 'histori':459 'hold':422 'homeland':276 'hood':97 'hous':346 'husband':192 'imag':120,406,413 'indian':324 'indiffer':298 'inferno':125 'johannesburg':451 'kraal':327 'laid':128 'lane':209 'late':429 'lead':218 'letter':132,257 'light':90 'lip':333 'lullabi':475 'major':139 'man':409,445 'might':421 'milit':2 'miner':107 'morgan':157 'mug':72 'mustach':142 'natal':471 'near':329 'northward':170 'ocean':325 'offer':302 'one':137,224,349 'ontario':165 'pass':150,208,493 'passbook':8,211,489 'philadelphia':243 'photograph':5,67,232,403 'pictur':395 'platform':99,261 'pledg':271 'polish':114 'predestin':433 'press':436 'profil':336 'puddl':112 'pummel':84 'pus':56 'queenstown':263 'quiet':103 'recept':255 'remembr':361 'ride':183 'rise':340 'road':217,343 'robe':385 'run':200 'runaway':76 'ruthless':301 'sail':241 'sergeant':138 'set':240 'shaka':297 'sharpevill':153,367 'ship':321 'shirt':47,496 'shoe':109 'shot':73 'shoulder':214 'shudder':328 'silenc':364 'simpl':71 'sing':478 'sit':318 'skin':63 'smoke':93 'soft':95 'song':483 'soot':117 'soweto':82 'speak':177 'spear':381 'spin':281 'stand':110 'stood':348 'streak':31 'striation':61 'struck':267 'sun':434 'swaddl':59 'tailfront':43 'talk':187 'think':351 'though':86 'thread':286 'three':197 'tongu':416 'took':447 'torso':123 'town':456 'train':80,449 'trek':169 'trestl':466 'tunnel':64 'turn':334,382 'turret':88 'twenti':196 'twenty-thre':195 'two':268 'voic':442 'walk':427 'want':253 'war':246 'warrior':270,296 'water':33 'wear':50,411,501 'weigh':288 'wire':85 'wive':309 'woman':182 'women':354 'word':397 'worship':469 'would':49,374 'wrinkl':15,438 'wrong':207 'year':198,247 'zulu':269,474

Splicing the meats with fluids seasoned on the dressing room table, she sings “the bump gone” refrain in this 69-degree oven, unstuffing her twin yolks carved from the breast, the dark meat  wrapped in tinfoil and clean newspaper; the half black registered nurse  hums her six years in an orphanage,  her adopted white family, breaded and primed in a posse, rising in clan for their dinner.

694	Jazz Station	292		\nAbove the freeway, over the music, we speak of the strategy of poems, bleeding wives who ulcerate our voices rhythming in the cut-heat Portland stink from the Willamette River; arteries of smog fixate this place in each recording, music, music, on Impulse.  This little racist community has few friends;  thousands of deerslayers hum into Beaverton,  the one talk show driven out for their talk as the liberals dig in to KGO out of San Francisco;  we troop toward the Lloyd Center for the ice-skating, the colorette bloomered dream merchants on rented skates,  and the Sunday Chronicle near the big hotel. The poets, man and wife, write in the dimming air, their daughter in the toy rooms connecting them, the typewriter tacking the nails and snaps of her gown.

696	Double Elegy	292		\nWhatever city or country road   you two are on there are nettles, and the dark invisible elements cling to your skin though you do not cry and you do not scratch your arms at forty-five degree angles   as the landing point of a swan in the Ohio, the Detroit River; at the Paradise Theatre you named the cellist with the fanatical fingers of the plumber, the exorcist, and though the gimmicky at wrist   and kneecaps could lift the seance   table, your voice was real in the gait and laughter of Uncle   Henry, who could dance on either   leg, wooden or real, to the sound   of the troop train, megaphone,   catching the fine pitch of a singer   on the athletic fields of Virginia. At the Radisson Hotel, we once took a fine angel of the law to the convention center,   and put her down as an egret in the subzero platform of a friend— this is Minneapolis, the movies are all of strangers, holding themselves   in the delicacy of treading water,   while they wait for the trumpet   of the 20th Century Limited over the bluff or cranny. You two men like to confront. the craters of history and spillage,   our natural infections of you   innoculating blankets and fur,   ethos of cadaver and sunflower. I hold the dogwood blossom, eat the pear, and watch the nettle   swim up in the pools of the completed song of Leadbelly and Little Crow   crooning the buffalo and horse   to the changes and the bridge   of a twelve-string guitar, the melody of “Irene”; this is really goodbye— I can see the precious stones of embolism and consumption on the platinum wires of the mouth: in the flowing rivers, in the public baths   of Ohio and Michigan.\n	'20th':183 'angel':136 'angl':41 'arm':35 'athlet':123 'bath':292 'blanket':209 'blossom':221 'bluff':188 'bridg':253 'buffalo':245 'cadav':214 'catch':114 'cellist':62 'center':143 'centuri':184 'chang':250 'citi':4 'cling':20 'complet':236 'confront':196 'consumpt':277 'convent':142 'could':80,98 'countri':6 'cranni':190 'crater':198 'cri':28 'croon':243 'crow':242 'danc':99 'dark':17 'degre':40 'delicaci':171 'detroit':53 'dogwood':220 'doubl':1 'eat':222 'egret':150 'either':101 'elegi':2 'element':19 'embol':275 'etho':212 'exorcist':71 'fanat':65 'field':124 'fine':116,135 'finger':66 'five':39 'flow':287 'forti':38 'forty-f':37 'friend':157 'fur':211 'gait':91 'gimmicki':75 'goodby':267 'guitar':259 'henri':96 'histori':200 'hold':167,218 'hors':247 'hotel':130 'infect':205 'innocul':208 'invis':18 'iren':263 'kneecap':79 'land':44 'laughter':93 'law':139 'leadbelli':239 'leg':102 'lift':81 'like':194 'limit':185 'littl':241 'megaphon':113 'melodi':261 'men':193 'michigan':296 'minneapoli':160 'mouth':284 'movi':162 'name':60 'natur':204 'nettl':14,228 'ohio':51,294 'paradis':57 'pear':224 'pitch':117 'platform':154 'platinum':280 'plumber':69 'point':45 'pool':233 'precious':272 'public':291 'put':145 'radisson':129 'real':88,105 'realli':266 'river':54,288 'road':7 'scratch':33 'seanc':83 'see':270 'singer':120 'skin':23 'song':237 'sound':108 'spillag':202 'stone':273 'stranger':166 'string':258 'subzero':153 'sunflow':216 'swan':48 'swim':229 'tabl':84 'theatr':58 'though':24,73 'took':133 'train':112 'tread':173 'troop':111 'trumpet':180 'twelv':257 'twelve-str':256 'two':9,192 'uncl':95 'virginia':126 'voic':86 'wait':177 'watch':226 'water':174 'whatev':3 'wire':281 'wooden':103 'wrist':77
697	Sandra:  At the Beaver Trap	292		\n1 Nose only above water;  an hour in the ice melt; paw in a beaver trap, northern leaping through— the outlet sieving, setter- retriever staked to her trip,  The stake of her young  life run to nose level. Farmers adjacent to the lake  call ’round for the owner;  at least they call around,  and a man in a pickup pulls her out, her crushed  paw limp in the blazing sun. Shivering on our pantry floor, wrapped in a snowsuit, I see her dam the clamped paw staked to the sleeve,  licking for breaks, a light trickle of blood  spilling from a torn nail. 2 Next spring she will tramp  down our wire, stamp on six goslings,  swim for teal, run down blackbirds, drag deer bones in our garden. She limps on the compost pile, shakes at the vet, fishes under makeshift docks, ferrets out mink, frog, green snake, any animal scrimmage without stakes:  listen to her spayed name— warned, thwarted, disregarded, beautiful— 	'1':6 '2':109 'adjac':45 'anim':155 'around':58 'beauti':167 'beaver':4,20 'blackbird':127 'blaze':74 'blood':103 'bone':130 'break':98 'call':49,57 'clamp':90 'compost':138 'crush':69 'dam':88 'deer':129 'disregard':166 'dock':147 'drag':128 'farmer':44 'ferret':148 'fish':144 'floor':80 'frog':151 'garden':133 'gosl':121 'green':152 'hour':12 'ice':15 'lake':48 'leap':23 'least':55 'level':43 'lick':96 'life':39 'light':100 'limp':71,135 'listen':159 'makeshift':146 'man':61 'melt':16 'mink':150 'nail':108 'name':163 'next':110 'northern':22 'nose':7,42 'outlet':26 'owner':53 'pantri':79 'paw':17,70,91 'pickup':64 'pile':139 'pull':65 'retriev':29 'round':50 'run':40,125 'sandra':1 'scrimmag':156 'see':86 'setter':28 'shake':140 'shiver':76 'siev':27 'six':120 'sleev':95 'snake':153 'snowsuit':84 'spay':162 'spill':104 'spring':111 'stake':30,35,92,158 'stamp':118 'sun':75 'swim':122 'teal':124 'thwart':165 'torn':107 'tramp':114 'trap':5,21 'trickl':101 'trip':33 'vet':143 'warn':164 'water':10 'wire':117 'without':157 'wrap':81 'young':38

She turns me on— There are very huge stars, man, in the sky, and from somewhere very far off someone hands me a slice of apple pie, with a gob of white, white ice cream on top of it,   and I eat it— Slowly.

707	Helsinki Window	293		\nGo out into brightened   space out there the fainter   yellowish place it makes for eye to enter out   to greyed penumbra all the   way to thoughtful searching   sight of all beyond that solid red both brick and seeming   metal roof or higher black   beyond the genial slope I   look at daily house top on   my own way up to heaven.          * Same roof, light’s gone   down back of it, behind   the crying end of day, “I   need something to do,” it’s   been again those other   things, what’s out there,   sodden edge of sea’s   bay, city’s graveyard, park   deserted, flattened aspect,   leaves gone colored fall   to sidewalk, street, the end   of all these days but   still this regal light.          * Trees stripped, rather shed of leaves, the black solid trunks up to fibrous mesh of smaller   branches, it is weather’s window,   weather’s particular echo, here   as if this place had been once,   now vacant, a door that had had   hinges swung in air’s peculiar   emptiness, greyed, slumped elsewhere,   asphalt blank of sidewalks, line of   linearly absolute black metal fence.          * Old sky freshened with cloud bulk   slides over frame of window the   shadings of softened greys a light   of air up out of this dense high   structured enclosure of buildings   top or pushed up flat of bricked roof   frame I love I love the safety of   small world this door frame back   of me the panes of simple glass yet   airy up sweep of birch trees sit in   flat below all designation declaration   here as clouds move so simply away.          * Windows now lit close out the   upper dark the night’s a face   three eyes far fainter than   the day all faced with light   inside the room makes eye re- flective see the common world   as one again no outside coming   in no more than walls and post- card pictures place faces across   that cautious dark the tree no   longer seen more than black edge   close branches somehow still between.          * He was at the edge of this reflective echo the words blown   back in air a bubble of suddenly   apparent person who walked to sit down by the familiar brook and   thought about his fading life all “fading life” in tremulous airy   perspect saw it hover in the surface   of that moving darkness at the edge   of sun’s passing water’s sudden depth   his own hands’ knotted surface the   sounding in himself of some other.          * One forty five afternoon red   car parked left hand side   of street no distinguishing   feature still wet day a bicycle   across the way a green door- way with arched upper window   a backyard edge of back wall to enclosed alley low down small   windows and two other cars green   and blue parked too and miles   and more miles still to go.          * This early still sunless morning when a chair’s   creak translates to cat’s cry a blackness still out the window might be apparent night when the house still sleeping behind me seems a bag of   immense empty silence and I feel the children   still breathing still shifting their dreams an   enigma will soon arrive here and the loved one   centers all in her heavy sleeping arm out the   leg pushed down bedclothes this body unseen un- known placed out there in night I can feel all   about me still sitting in this small spare pool of   light watching the letters the words try to speak.          * Classic emptiness it sits out there edge of   hierarchic roof top it marks with acid fine edge   of apparent difference it   is there here here that sky so up and out and where   it wants to be no birds no   other thing can for a   moment distract it be   beyond its simple space.\n	'absolut':183 'acid':594 'across':319,433 'afternoon':416 'air':169,206,351 'airi':247,378

711	Inside My Head	293		\ninside my head Inside my head a common room,   a common place, a common tune, a common wealth, a common doom inside my head. I close my eyes.   The horses run. Vast are the skies, and blue my passing thoughts’ surprise inside my head. What is this space   here found to be, what is this place if only me? Inside my head, whose face? the tools First there, it proves to be still here.   Distant as seen, it comes then to be near.   I found it here and there unclear. What if my hand had only been   extension of an outside reaching in to work with common means to change me then? All things are matter, yet these seem   caught in the impatience of a dream,   locked in the awkwardness they mean. the swan Peculiar that swan should mean a sound? I’d thought of gods and power, and wounds. But here in the curious quiet this one has settled down. All day the barking dogs were kept at bay.   Better than dogs, a single swan, they say,   will keep all such malignant force away and so preserve a calm, make pond a swelling lake— sound through the silent grove a shattering spate   of resonances, jarring the mind awake. the rose Into one’s self come in again, here as if ever now to once again begin with beauty’s old, old problem never-ending— Go, lovely rose ... So was that story told in some extraordinary place then, once upon a time so old   it seems an echo now as it again unfolds. I point to me to look out at the world. I see the white, white petals of this rose unfold.   I know such beauty in the world grows cold. the skull “Come closer. Now there is nothing left   either inside or out to gainsay death,”   the skull that keeps its secrets saith. The ways one went, the forms that were   empty as wind and yet they stirred the heart to its passion, all is passed over. Lighten the load. Close the eyes.   Let the mind loosen, the body die,   the bird fly off to the opening sky. the star Such space it comes again to be,   a room of such vast possibility,   a depth so great, a way so free. Life and its person, thinking to find a company wherewith to keep the time   a peaceful passage, a constant rhyme, stumble perforce, must lose their way,   know that they go too far to stay   stars in the sky, children at play.\n	'awak':212 'away':188 'awkward':133 'bark':168 'bay':173 'beauti':232,291 'begin':230 'better':174 'bird':358 'blue':40 'bodi':355 'calm':193 'caught':123 'chang':113 'children':426 'close':29,347 'closer':300 'cold':296 'come':82,219,299,370 'common':11,14,17,20,23,110 'compani':396 'constant':406 'curious':158 'd':146 'day':166 'death':312 'depth':381 'die':356 'distant':78 'dog':169,176 'doom':24 'dream':129 'echo':262 'either':306 'empti':328 'end':239 'ever':225 'extens':101 'extraordinari':250 'eye':31,349 'face':67 'far':419 'find':394 'first':70 'fli':359 'forc':187 'form':325 'found':53,88 'free':387 'gainsay':311 'go':240,417 'god':149 'great':383 'grove':203 'grow':295 'hand':97 'head':3,6,9,27,47,65 'heart':336 'hors':33 'impati':126 'insid':1,4,7,25,45,63,307 'jar':209 'keep':183,316,399 'kept':171 'know':289,414 'lake':198 'left':305 'let':350 'life':388 'lighten':344 'load':346 'lock':130 'look':273 'loosen':353 'lose':411 'love':241 'make':194 'malign':186 'matter':119 'mean':111,135,142 'mind':211,352 'must':410 'near':86 'never':238 'never-end':237 'noth':304 'old':234,235,258 'one':161,216,322 'open':363 'outsid':104 'pass':42,342 'passag':404 'passion':339 'peac':403 'peculiar':138 'perforc':409 'person':391 'petal':283 'place':15,59,251 'play':428 'point':269 'pond':195 'possibl':379 'power':151 'preserv':191 'problem':236 'prove':73 'quiet':159 'reach':105 'reson':208 'rhyme':407 'room':12,375 'rose':214,242,286 'run':34 'saith':319 'say':181 'secret':318 'see':279 'seem':122,260 'seen':80 'self':218 'settl':163 'shatter':205 'silent':202 'singl':178 'skull':298,314 'sky':38,364,425 'sound':144,199 'space':51,368 'spate':206 'star':366,422 'stay':421 'still':76 'stir':334 'stori':246 'stumbl':408 'surpris':44 'swan':137,140,179 'swell':197 'thing':117 'think':392 'thought':43,147 'time':256,401 'told':247 'tool':69 'tune':18 'unclear':93 'unfold':267,287 'upon':254 'vast':35,378 'way':321,385,413 'wealth':21 'went':323 'wherewith':397 'white':281,282 'whose':66 'wind':330 'work':108 'world':277,294 'wound':153 'yet':120,332
712	Yesterdays	293		\nSixty-two, sixty-three, I most remember   As time W. C. Williams dies and we are   Back from a hard two years in Guatemala   Where the meager provision of being   Schoolmaster for the kids of the patrones Of two coffee plantations has managed   Neither a life nor money. Leslie dies in   Horror of bank giving way as she and her   Sister and their friends tunnel in to make   A cubby. We live in an old cement brick   Farmhouse already inside the city limits   Of Albuquerque. Or that has all really   Happened and we go to Vancouver where,   Thanks to friends Warren and Ellen Tallman,   I get a job teaching at the University of British   Columbia. It’s all a curious dream, a rush   To get out of the country before the sad   Invasion of the Bay of Pigs, that bleak use   Of power. One of my British colleagues   Has converted the assets of himself and   His wife to gold bullion and keeps the   Ingots in a sturdy suitcase pushed under   Their bed. I love the young, at least I   Think I do, in their freshness, their attempt   To find ways into Canada from the western   Reaches. Otherwise the local country seems   Like a faded Edwardian sitcom. A stunned   Stoned woman runs one Saturday night up   And down the floors of the Hydro Electric   Building on Pender with the RCMP in hot Pursuit where otherwise we stood in long   Patient lines, extending often several blocks   Up the street. We were waiting to get our   Hands stamped and to be given a 12 pack   Of Molson’s. I think, I dream, I write the   Final few chapters of The Island, the despairs   Gathering at the end. I read Richard Brautigan’s   Trout Fishing In America but am too uptight   To enjoy his quiet, bright wit. Then that   Summer there is the great Vancouver Poetry   Festival, Allen comes back from India, Olson   From Gloucester, beloved Robert Duncan   From Stinson Beach. Denise reads “Hypocrite   Women” to the Burnaby ladies and Gary Snyder,   Philip Whalen, and Margaret Avison are there   Too along with a veritable host of the young.   Then it’s autumn again. I’ve quit my job   And we head back to Albuquerque   And I teach again at the university, and   Sometime just about then I must have   Seen myself as others see or saw me,   Even like in a mirror, but could not quite   Accept either their reassuring friendship   Or their equally locating anger. Selfish,   Empty, I kept at it. Thirty-eight years later   I seem to myself still much the same,   Even if I am happier, I think, and older.\n	'12':264 'accept':406 'albuquerqu':88,373 'allen':317 'along':350 'alreadi':82 'america':296 'anger':415 'asset':155 'attempt':190 'autumn':361 'avison':346 'back':20,319,371 'bank':57 'bay':139 'beach':330 'bed':175 'belov':325 'bleak':143 'block':247 'brautigan':291 'brick':80 'bright':305 'british':117,150 'build':227 'bullion':163 'burnabi':337 'c':14 'canada':195 'cement':79 'chapter':278 'citi':85 'coffe':43 'colleagu':151 'columbia':118 'come':318 'convert':153 'could':403 'countri':132,203 'cubbi':73 'curious':123 'denis':331 'despair':283 'die':16,53 'dream':124,272 'duncan':327 'edwardian':208 'eight':424 'either':407 'electr':226 'ellen':106 'empti':417 'end':287 'enjoy':302 'equal':413 'even':397,435 'extend':244 'fade':207 'farmhous':81 'festiv':316 'final':276 'find':192 'fish':294 'floor':222 'fresh':188 'friend':67,103 'friendship':410 'gari':340 'gather':284 'get':109,128,255 'give':58 'given':262 'gloucest':324 'go':97 'gold':162 'great':313 'guatemala':27 'hand':257 'happen':94 'happier':439 'hard':23 'head':370 'horror':55 'host':354 'hot':234 'hydro':225 'hypocrit':333 'india':321 'ingot':167 'insid':83 'invas':136 'island':281 'job':111,367 'keep':165 'kept':419 'kid':37 'ladi':338 'later':426 'least':181 'lesli':52 'life':49 'like':205,398 'limit':86 'line':243 'live':75 'local':202 'locat':414 'long':241 'love':177 'make':71 'manag':46 'margaret':345 'meager':30 'mirror':401 'molson':267 'money':51 'much':432 'must':387 'neither':47 'night':217 'often':245 'old':78 'older':443 'olson':322 'one':147,215 'other':392 'otherwis':200,237 'pack':265 'patient':242 'patron':40 'pender':229 'philip':342 'pig':141 'plantat':44 'poetri':315 'power':146 'provis':31 'pursuit':235 'push':172 'quiet':304 'quit':365,405 'rcmp':232 'reach':199 'read':289,332 'realli':93 'reassur':409 'rememb':10 'richard':290 'robert':326 'run':214 'rush':126 'sad':135 'saturday':216 'saw':395 'schoolmast':34 'see':393 'seem':204,428 'seen':389 'selfish':416 'sever':246 'sister':64 'sitcom':209 'sixti':3,6 'sixty-thre':5 'sixty-two':2 'snyder':341 'sometim':382 'stamp':258 'still':431 'stinson':329 'stone':212 'stood':239 'street':250 'stun':211 'sturdi':170 'suitcas':171 'summer':309 'tallman':107 'teach':112,376 'thank':101 'think':183,270,441 'thirti':423 'thirty-eight':422 'three':7 'time':12 'trout':293 'tunnel':68 'two':4,24,42 'univers':115,380 'uptight':300 'use':144 'vancouv':99,314 've':364 'verit':353 'w':13 'wait':253 'warren':104 'way':59,193 'western':198 'whalen':343 'wife':160 'william':15 'wit':306 'woman':213 'women':334 'write':274 'year':25,425 'yesterday':1 'young':179,357

And it was more than a pinch or sting, It’s a sensation of hunger That makes us spring off the bottom and swim out deep  And safe. “No blue stripes on cheeks; no red on fins; Old individual’s belly coppery red or brassy.”  As others see you, I think these indicate, Who would have you all one shade then wouldn’t have you. At your full table later, over muskellunge and lemon,  We read in the book the fish that liked us Has certain maxillaries “wholly wanting.” Your gourmet bluegill: It lives in the eye of the beholder, it swims the vitreous  Humor, would eat even your blind spot!  But we think we can paddle out there until all Goes dark, and we are wholly desirable, and too much.\n	'beast':9 'beauti':11,29 'behold':153 'belli':94 'blind':163 'blue':83 'bluegil':19,145 'book':132 'bottom':75 'brassi':98 'care':24 'certain':139 'cheek':86 'contrast':51 'copperi':95 'dark':176 'darkest':44 'deep':79 'delicaci':2,38 'desir':181 'eat':160 'even':161 'eye':150 'fin':90 'fish':134 'friend':3 'full':121 'goe':175 'gourmet':144 'humor':158 'hunger':68 'indic':106 'individu':92 'jaw':34 'lake':17 'later':123 'lemon':127 'like':136 'littl':33 'live':147 'lose':27 'love':10 'make':70 'mark':30 'maxillari':140 'much':184 'muskellung':125 'old':91 'one':112 'other':100 'paddl':170 'part':45 'pinch':60 'purchas':42 'read':129 'red':88,96 'rememb':4 'safe':81 'said':22 'see':101 'sensat':66 'shade':113 'show':7 'skin':48 'spot':164 'spring':72 'sting':62 'stripe':84 'swim':77,155 'tabl':122 'think':104,167 'us':8,40,53,71,137 'vitreous':157 'wade':14 'want':142 'wholli':141,180 'would':108,159 'wouldn':115
714	For Elizabeth Bishop	294		\nThe child I left your class to have   Later had a habit of sleeping   With her arms around a globe She’d unscrewed, dropped, and dented. I always felt she could possess it,   The pink countries and the mauve And the ocean which got to keep its blue. Coming from the Southern Hemisphere to teach,   Which you had never had to do, you took A bare-walled room, alone, its northern   Windowscapes as gray as walls. To decorate, you’d only brought a black madonna. I thought you must have skipped summer that year,   Southern winter, southern spring, then north For winter over again. Still, it pleased you To take credit for introducing us, And later to bring our daughter a small flipbook Of partners dancing, and a ring   With a secret whistle. —All are Broken now like her globe, but she remembers   Them as I recall the black madonna   Facing you across the room so that   In a way you had the dark fertile life   You were always giving gifts to.   Your smaller admirer off to school,   I take the globe and roll it away: where   On it now is someone like you?\n	'across':157 'admir':179 'alon':73 'alway':31,173 'arm':20 'around':21 'away':190 'bare':70 'bare-wal':69 'bishop':3 'black':88,153 'blue':51 'bring':122 'broken':140 'brought':86 'child':5 'class':9 'come':52 'could':34 'countri':39 'credit':115 'd':25,84 'danc':130 'dark':168 'daughter':124 'decor':82 'dent':29 'drop':27 'elizabeth':2 'face':155 'felt':32 'fertil':169 'flipbook':127 'gift':175 'give':174 'globe':23,144,186 'got':47 'gray':78 'habit':15 'hemispher':56 'introduc':117 'keep':49 'later':12,120 'left':7 'life':170 'like':142,197 'madonna':89,154 'mauv':42 'must':93 'never':62 'north':104 'northern':75 'ocean':45 'partner':129 'pink':38 'pleas':111 'possess':35 'recal':151 'rememb':147 'ring':133 'roll':188 'room':72,159 'school':182 'secret':136 'skip':95 'sleep':17 'small':126 'smaller':178 'someon':196 'southern':55,99,101 'spring':102 'still':109 'summer':96 'take':114,184 'teach':58 'thought':91 'took':67 'unscrew':26 'us':118 'wall':71,80 'way':164 'whistl':137 'windowscap':76 'winter':100,106 'year':98
715	A Pumpkin at New Year’s	294		\nHeads were rolling down the highway in high slat trucks.   I knew it was time to buy you and found you, The last sphere unscarred and undistorted in the store,   Big as my own head. It was time too to leave you uncut and full-featured,   Like the grandpa of twenty-five pumpkins in my past,   Khrushchev-cheeked and dwelling on yourself,   Great knee of my childhood. I plainly thought you would rot. I remembered the fetor of other pumpkins, Their blue populations coming out of hiding as if at the end   Of some apocalypse. I devoted a day to reading up on minor cucurbits:   I learned your dozen names in African And came home ready to raise or raze you,   Positive of change. But so far—eternity. I think I would not like   Eternity, after I had used my senses up, As I’ve tried with you—fingertips dragging over your world   Pole to pole Till they go dead like explorers, nostril cilia Detecting your fragrance more delicate than they— And my patience. It’s Christmas, it’s a new year   And I hear Of a family who’s kept you for four ... You endure like matter manufactured And indeed your stem seems punched into your orange gathers Like a button in a mattress. Shall I give you a room or a shrine? And shall I   Purchase you a mate and family, When ours is so inadequate, fixed upon your window   Deathbed as we are, Centered upon a time and birth, new holiday, new friends,   New pumpkins, celebrating when all That has failed us has passed away. You have not failed.\n	'african':121 'apocalyps':104 'away':277 'big':37 'birth':261 'blue':91 'button':221 'buy':23 'came':123 'celebr':268 'center':256 'chang':133 'cheek':67 'childhood':76 'christma':186 'cilia':173 'come':93 'cucurbit':114 'day':108 'dead':169 'deathb':252 'delic':178 'detect':174 'devot':106 'dozen':118 'drag':159 'dwell':69 'end':101 'endur':205 'etern':137,144 'explor':171 'fail':273,281 'famili':197,242 'far':136 'featur':53 'fetor':86 'fingertip':158 'five':60 'fix':248 'found':26 'four':203 'fragranc':176 'friend':265 'full':52 'full-featur':51 'gather':218 'give':227 'go':168 'grandpa':56 'great':72 'head':7,41 'hear':194 'hide':96 'high':14 'highway':12 'holiday':263 'home':124 'inadequ':247 'inde':210 'kept':200 'khrushchev':66 'khrushchev-cheek':65 'knee':73 'knew':18 'last':29 'learn':116 'leav':47 'like':54,143,170,206,219 'manufactur':208 'mate':240 'matter':207 'mattress':224 'minor':113 'name':119 'new':4,190,262,264,266 'nostril':172 'orang':217 'pass':276 'past':64 'patienc':183 'plain':78 'pole':163,165 'popul':92 'posit':131 'pumpkin':2,61,89,267 'punch':214 'purchas':237 'rais':127 'raze':129 'read':110 'readi':125 'rememb':84 'roll':9 'room':230 'rot':82 'seem':213 'sens':150 'shall':225,235 'shrine':233 'slat':15 'sphere':30 'stem':212 'store':36 'think':139 'thought':79 'till':166 'time':21,44,259 'tri':155 'truck':16 'twenti':59 'twenty-f':58 'uncut':49 'undistort':33 'unscar':31 'upon':249,257 'us':274 'use':148 've':154 'window':251 'world':162 'would':81,141 'year':5,191

718	Lions	294		\nLions don’t need your help. In the Serengeti,  For instance, one thousand like the very rich Hold sway over more than Connecticut. The mane  Of the lion, like the hooked jaw of the male salmon, Acts as a shield for defense and is the gift Of sexual selection. His eyes are fathomless amber. The lion is the most social of the big cats. Pride members are affectionate among themselves. They rub cheeks when they meet. They rest And hunt together. And cubs suckle indiscriminately. But strangers or members of a neighboring pride are not  Usually accepted. If a pride male meets a strange female He may greet her in a friendly fashion  And even mate with her But the pride females will drive her off. Male lions, usually depicted as indolent freeloaders Who let the lionesses do all the hunting, are not mere  Parasites. They maintain the integrity of the territory. Lions eat communally but completely lack table manners.  Indeed, lions give the impression that their evolution Toward a social existence is incomplete—that cooperation  In achieving a task does not yet include The equal division of the spoils. More bad news: lions are not good parents. But prowess, that they have. Their courage comes  From being built, like an automobile, For power. A visible lion is usually a safe lion,  But one should never feel safe Because almost always there is something one can’t see.  Given protection and power A lion does not need to be clever. Now, lions are not the most likable kind of animal Unless you are a certain type of person, That is, not necessarily leonine in the sense of manly Or ferocious, but one who wouldn’t mind resting twenty  Of twenty-four hours a day and who is not beyond Stealing someone else’s kill  About half the time. Lions are not my favorite kind of animal,  Gazelles seem nicer, A zebra has his own sort of appealing pathos,  Especially when he is sure prey for the lion. Lions have little to offer the spirit. If we made of ourselves parks and placed the lion In the constituent he most resembled  He would be in our blood.\n	'accept':98 'achiev':179 'act':38 'affection':69 'almost':231 'alway':232 'amber':55 'among':70 'anim':261,318 'appeal':329 'automobil':213 'bad':193 'beyond':301 'big':64 'blood':368 'built':210 'cat':65 'certain':266 'cheek':74 'clever':251 'come':207 'communal':156 'complet':158 'connecticut':24 'constitu':359 'cooper':177 'courag':206 'cub':84 'day':296 'defens':43 'depict':131 'divis':188 'drive':125 'eat':155 'els':304 'equal':187 'especi':331 'even':116 'evolut':169 'exist':173 'eye':52 'fashion':114 'fathomless':54 'favorit':315 'feel':228 'femal':106,123 'feroci':281 'four':293 'freeload':134 'friend':113 'gazell':319 'gift':47 'give':164 'given':240 'good':198 'greet':109 'half':308 'help':7 'hold':19 'hook':32 'hour':294 'hunt':81,142 'impress':166 'includ':185 'incomplet':175 'inde':162 'indiscrimin':86 'indol':133 'instanc':12 'integr':150 'jaw':33 'kill':306 'kind':259,316 'lack':159 'leonin':274 'let':136 'likabl':258 'like':15,30,211 'lion':1,2,29,57,129,154,163,195,218,223,245,253,311,339,340,356 'lioness':138 'littl':342 'made':349 'maintain':148 'male':36,102,128 'man':279 'mane':26 'manner':161 'mate':117 'may':108 'meet':77,103 'member':67,90 'mere':145 'mind':287 'necessarili':273 'need':5,248 'neighbor':93 'never':227 'news':194 'nicer':321 'offer':344 'one':13,225,236,283 'parasit':146 'parent':199 'park':352 'patho':330 'person':269 'place':354 'power':215,243 'prey':336 'pride':66,94,101,122 'protect':241 'prowess':201 'resembl':362 'rest':79,288 'rich':18 'rub':73 'safe':222,229 'salmon':37 'see':239 'seem':320 'select':50 'sens':277 'serengeti':10 'sexual':49 'shield':41 'social':61,172 'someon':303 'someth':235 'sort':327 'spirit':346 'spoil':191 'steal':302 'strang':105 'stranger':88 'suckl':85 'sure':335 'sway':20 'tabl':160 'task':181 'territori':153 'thousand':14 'time':310 'togeth':82 'toward':170 'twenti':289,292 'twenty-four':291 'type':267 'unless':262 'usual':97,130,220 'visibl':217 'would':364 'wouldn':285 'yet':184 'zebra':323

731	Autobiography	295		\nI am leading a quiet life   in Mike’s Place every day   watching the champs of the Dante Billiard Parlor   and the French pinball addicts.   I am leading a quiet life   on lower East Broadway.   I am an American. I was an American boy. I read the American Boy Magazine   and became a boy scout   in the suburbs. I thought I was Tom Sawyer   catching crayfish in the Bronx River and imagining the Mississippi.   I had a baseball mit and an American Flyer bike. I delivered the Woman’s Home Companion   at five in the afternoon or the Herald Trib at five in the morning. I still can hear the paper thump   on lost porches. I had an unhappy childhood.   I saw Lindbergh land. I looked homeward and saw no angel. I got caught stealing pencils from the Five and Ten Cent Store   the same month I made Eagle Scout. I chopped trees for the CCC   and sat on them. I landed in Normandy in a rowboat that turned over. I have seen the educated armies on the beach at Dover. I have seen Egyptian pilots in purple clouds   shopkeepers rolling up their blinds   at midday potato salad and dandelions at anarchist picnics. I am reading ‘Lorna Doone’ and a life of John Most terror of the industrialist a bomb on his desk at all times. I have seen the garbagemen parade   in the Columbus Day Parade behind the glib farting trumpeters. I have not been out to the Cloisters   in a long time nor to the Tuileries but I still keep thinking of going. I have seen the garbagemen parade   when it was snowing. I have eaten hotdogs in ballparks. I have heard the Gettysburg Address   and the Ginsberg Address. I like it here and I won’t go back where I came from. I too have ridden boxcars boxcars boxcars.   I have travelled among unknown men.   I have been in Asia with Noah in the Ark. I was in India when Rome was built. I have been in the Manger with an Ass. I have seen the Eternal Distributor   from a White Hill in South San Francisco and the Laughing Woman at Loona Park   outside the Fun House in a great rainstorm still laughing. I have heard the sound of revelry   by night. I have wandered lonely as a crowd. I am leading a quiet life outside of Mike’s Place every day   watching the world walk by in its curious shoes. I once started out to walk around the world but ended up in Brooklyn. That Bridge was too much for me.   I have engaged in silence exile and cunning. I flew too near the sun and my wax wings fell off. I am looking for my Old Man   whom I never knew. I am looking for the Lost Leader   with whom I flew. Young men should be explorers.   Home is where one starts from.   But Mother never told me there’d be scenes like this. Womb-weary I rest I have travelled. I have seen goof city. I have seen the mass mess. I have heard Kid Ory cry. I have heard a trombone preach.   I have heard Debussy strained thru a sheet. I have slept in a hundred islands where books were trees.   I have heard the birds   that sound like bells. I have worn grey flannel trousers and walked upon the beach of hell. I have dwelt in a hundred cities where trees were books. What subways what taxis what cafes! What women with blind breasts limbs lost among skyscrapers! I have seen the statues of heroes at carrefours. Danton weeping at a metro entrance Columbus in Barcelona pointing Westward up the Ramblas toward the American Express   Lincoln in his stony chair   And a great Stone Face   in North Dakota. I know that Columbus   did not invent America. I have heard a hundred housebroken Ezra Pounds.   They should all be freed.   It is long since I was a herdsman. I am leading a quiet life   in Mike’s Place every day   reading the Classified columns. I have read the Reader’s Digest from cover to cover and noted the close identification of the United States and the Promised Land where every coin is marked   In God We Trust but the dollar bills do not have it being gods unto themselves.   I read the Want Ads daily   looking for a stone a leaf   an unfound door. I hear America singing in the Yellow Pages. One could never tell the soul has its rages. I read the papers every day   and hear humanity amiss in the sad plethora of print. I see where Walden Pond has been drained   to make an amusement park.   I see they’re making Melville   eat his whale. I see another war is coming   but I won’t be there to fight it.   I have read the writing on the outhouse wall. I helped Kilroy write it. I marched up Fifth Avenue blowing on a bugle in a tight platoon   but hurried back to the Casbah   looking for my dog. I see a similarity between dogs and me. Dogs are the true observers   walking up and down the world   thru the Molloy country. I have walked down alleys   too narrow for Chryslers. I have seen a hundred horseless milkwagons   in a vacant lot in Astoria. Ben Shahn never painted them   but they’re there askew in Astoria. I have heard the junkman’s obbligato.   I have ridden superhighways   and believed the billboard’s promises   Crossed the Jersey Flats and seen the Cities of the Plain And wallowed in the wilds of Westchester with its roving bands of natives in stationwagons. I have seen them. I am the man.   I was there.   I suffered somewhat. I am an American. I have a passport. I did not suffer in public. And I’m too young to die. I am a selfmade man. And I have plans for the future. I am in line   for a top job. I may be moving on to Detroit. I am only temporarily a tie salesman. I am a good Joe. I am an open book to my boss. I am a complete mystery to my closest friends. I am leading a quiet life in Mike’s Place every day   contemplating my navel. I am a part of the body’s long madness. I have wandered in various nightwoods.   I have leaned in drunken doorways. I have written wild stories without punctuation. I am the man. I was there.   I suffered   somewhat. I have sat in an uneasy chair. I am a tear of the sun.   I am a hill where poets run. I invented the alphabet after watching the flight of cranes   who made letters with their legs. I am a lake upon a plain.   I am a word in a tree. I am a hill of poetry.   I am a raid on the inarticulate. I have dreamt that all my teeth fell out   but my tongue lived   to tell the tale. For I am a still of poetry. I am a bank of song.   I am a playerpiano in an abandoned casino   on a seaside esplanade   in a dense fog still playing. I see a similarity between the Laughing Woman and myself. I have heard the sound of summer   in the rain. I have seen girls on boardwalks   have complicated sensations.   I understand their hesitations. I am a gatherer of fruit.   I have seen how kisses   cause euphoria. I have risked enchantment.   I have seen the Virgin   in an appletree at Chartres And Saint Joan burn at the Bella Union. I have seen giraffes in junglejims their necks like love wound around the iron circumstances   of the world. I have seen the Venus Aphrodite   armless in her drafty corridor.   I have heard a siren sing   at One Fifth Avenue. I have seen the White Goddess dancing   in the Rue des Beaux Arts   on the Fourteenth of July   and the Beautiful Dame Without Mercy   picking her nose in Chumley’s.   She did not speak English.   She had yellow hair and a hoarse voice I am leading a quiet life   in Mike’s Place every day   watching the pocket pool players   making the minestrone scene   wolfing the macaronis   and I have read somewhere   the Meaning of Existence   yet have forgotten just exactly where. But I am the man And I’ll be there. And I may cause the lips   of those who are asleep   to speak. And I may make my notebooks   into sheaves of grass.   And I may write my own   eponymous epitaph instructing the horsemen   to pass.\n	'abandon':1196 'ad':733 'addict':26 'address':288,292

732	Underwear	295		\nI didn’t get much sleep last night thinking about underwear Have you ever stopped to consider   underwear in the abstract   When you really dig into it some shocking problems are raised   Underwear is something   we all have to deal with   Everyone wears some kind of underwear The Pope wears underwear I hope The Governor of Louisiana   wears underwear I saw him on TV He must have had tight underwear He squirmed a lot Underwear can really get you in a bind You have seen the underwear ads for men and women so alike but so different Women’s underwear holds things up Men’s underwear holds things down   Underwear is one thing   men and women have in common   Underwear is all we have between us You have seen the three-color pictures with crotches encircled to show the areas of extra strength and three-way stretch promising full freedom of action Don’t be deceived It’s all based on the two-party system which doesn’t allow much freedom of choice   the way things are set up   America in its Underwear struggles thru the night Underwear controls everything in the end   Take foundation garments for instance   They are really fascist forms of underground government making people believe something but the truth telling you what you can or can’t do   Did you ever try to get around a girdle   Perhaps Non-Violent Action is the only answer Did Gandhi wear a girdle? Did Lady Macbeth wear a girdle? Was that why Macbeth murdered sleep?   And that spot she was always rubbing— Was it really in her underwear? Modern anglosaxon ladies must have huge guilt complexes always washing and washing and washing   Out damned spot Underwear with spots very suspicious   Underwear with bulges very shocking   Underwear on clothesline a great flag of freedom   Someone has escaped his Underwear   May be naked somewhere Help! But don’t worry Everybody’s still hung up in it There won’t be no real revolution And poetry still the underwear of the soul   And underwear still covering a multitude of faults in the geological sense— strange sedimentary stones, inscrutable cracks!   If I were you I’d keep aside an oversize pair of winter underwear   Do not go naked into that good night   And in the meantime keep calm and warm and dry No use stirring ourselves up prematurely   ‘over Nothing’ Move forward with dignity hand in vest Don’t get emotional And death shall have no dominion   There’s plenty of time my darling Are we not still young and easy Don’t shout\n	'abstract':22 'action':155,240 'ad':89 'alik':95 'allow':173 'alway':267,283 'america':184 'anglosaxon':276 'answer':244 'area':142 'around':233 'asid':370 'base':163 'believ':213 'bind':83 'bulg':299 'calm':390 'choic':177 'clotheslin':304 'color':134 'common':120 'complex':282 'consid':18 'control':193 'cover':349 'crack':362 'crotch':137 'd':368 'damn':290 'darl':426 'deal':41 'death':415 'deceiv':159 'didn':3 'differ':98 'dig':26 'digniti':406 'doesn':171 'dominion':419 'dri':394 'easi':433 'emot':413 'encircl':138 'end':197 'escap':312 'ever':15,229 'everybodi':324 'everyon':43 'everyth':194 'extra':144 'fascist':206 'fault':353 'flag':307 'form':207 'forward':404 'foundat':199 'freedom':153,175,309 'full':152 'gandhi':246 'garment':200 'geolog':356 'get':5,79,232,412 'girdl':235,249,255 'go':379 'good':383 'govern':210 'governor':56 'great':306 'guilt':281 'hand':407 'help':319 'hold':102,108 'hope':54 'huge':280 'hung':327 'inscrut':361 'instanc':202 'keep':369,389 'kind':46 'ladi':251,277 'last':8 'lot':75 'louisiana':58 'macbeth':252,259 'make':211 'may':315 'meantim':388 'men':91,105,115 'modern':275 'move':403 'much':6,174 'multitud':351 'murder':260 'must':67,278 'nake':317,380 'night':9,191,384 'non':238 'non-viol':237 'noth':402 'one':113 'overs':372 'pair':373 'parti':168 'peopl':212 'perhap':236 'pictur':135 'plenti':422 'poetri':339 'pope':50 'prematur':400 'problem':31 'promis':151 'rais':33 'real':336 'realli':25,78,205,271 'revolut':337 'rub':268 'saw':62 'sedimentari':359 'seen':86,130 'sens':357 'set':182 'shall':416 'shock':30,301 'shout':436 'show':140 'sleep':7,261 'someon':310 'someth':36,214 'somewher':318 'soul':345 'spot':264,291,294 'squirm':73 'still':326,340,348,430 'stir':397 'stone':360 'stop':16 'strang':358 'strength':145 'stretch':150 'struggl':188 'suspici':296 'system':169 'take':198 'tell':218 'thing':103,109,114,180 'think':10 'three':133,148 'three-color':132 'three-way':147 'thru':189 'tight':70 'time':424 'tri':230 'truth':217 'tv':65 'two':167 'two-parti':166 'underground':209 'underwear':1,12,19,34,48,52,60,71,76,88,101,107,111,121,187,192,274,292,297,302,314,342,347,376 'us':127 'use':396 'vest':409 'violent':239 'warm':392 'wash':284,286,288 'way':149,179 'wear':44,51,59,247,253 'winter':375 'women':93,99,117 'won':332 'worri':323 'young':431
733	The Minks	20		\nIn the backyard of our house on Norwood,  there were five hundred steel cages lined up,  each with a wooden box roofed with tar paper; inside, two stories, with straw for a bed. Sometimes the minks would pace  back and forth wildly, looking for a way out; or else they’d hide in their wooden houses, even when  we’d put the offering of raw horse meat on their trays, as if  they knew they were beautiful and wanted to deprive us. In spring the placid kits drank with glazed eyes. Sometimes the mothers would go mad  and snap their necks. My uncle would lift the roof like a god  who might lift our roof, look down on us  and take us out to safety. Sometimes one would escape. He would go down on his hands and knees,  aiming a flashlight like a bullet of light, hoping to catch the orange gold of its eyes. He wore huge boots, gloves so thick their little teeth couldn’t bite through.  “They’re wild,” he’d say. “Never trust them.” Each afternoon when I put the scoop of raw meat rich  with eggs and vitamins on their trays,  I’d call to each a greeting. Their small thin faces would follow as if slightly curious.  In fall they went out in a van, returning sorted, matched, their skins hanging down on huge metal  hangers, pinned by their mouths. My uncle would take them out when company came and drape them over his arm—the sweetest cargo.  He’d blow down the pelts softly and the hairs would part for his breath and show the shining underlife which, like  the shining of the soul, gives us each character and beauty.\n	'afternoon':182 'aim':141 'arm':253 'back':41 'backyard':5 'beauti':79,289 'bed':35 'bite':170 'blow':259 'boot':161 'box':23 'breath':271 'bullet':146 'cage':16 'call':201 'came':247 'cargo':256 'catch':151 'charact':287 'compani':246 'couldn':168 'curious':215 'd':53,62,176,200,258 'depriv':83 'drank':90 'drape':249 'egg':193 'els':51 'escap':131 'even':59 'eye':93,157 'face':209 'fall':217 'five':13 'flashlight':143 'follow':211 'forth':43 'give':284 'glaze':92 'glove':162 'go':98,134 'god':112 'gold':154 'greet':205 'hair':266 'hand':138 'hang':229 'hanger':234 'hide':54 'hope':149 'hors':68 'hous':8,58 'huge':160,232 'hundr':14 'insid':28 'kit':89 'knee':140 'knew':76 'lift':107,115 'light':148 'like':110,144,278 'line':17 'littl':166 'look':45,118 'mad':99 'match':226 'meat':69,190 'metal':233 'might':114 'mink':2,38 'mother':96 'mouth':238 'neck':103 'never':178 'norwood':10 'offer':65 'one':129 'orang':153 'pace':40 'paper':27 'part':268 'pelt':262 'pin':235 'placid':88 'put':63,185 'raw':67,189 're':173 'return':224 'rich':191 'roof':24,109,117 'safeti':127 'say':177 'scoop':187 'shine':275,280 'show':273 'skin':228 'slight':214 'small':207 'snap':101 'soft':263 'sometim':36,94,128 'sort':225 'soul':283 'spring':86 'steel':15 'stori':30 'straw':32 'sweetest':255 'take':123,242 'tar':26 'teeth':167 'thick':164 'thin':208 'tray':72,198 'trust':179 'two':29 'uncl':105,240 'underlif':276 'us':84,121,124,285 'van':223 'vitamin':195 'want':81 'way':48 'went':219 'wild':44,174 'wooden':22,57 'wore':159 'would':39,97,106,130,133,210,241,267
734	Christmas Eve: My Mother Dressing	20		\nMy mother was not impressed with her beauty; once a year she put it on like a costume, plaited her black hair, slick as cornsilk, down past her hips,  in one rope-thick braid, turned it, carefully, hand over hand,  and fixed it at the nape of her neck, stiff and elegant as a crown,  with tortoise pins, like huge insects, some belonging to her dead mother, some to my living grandmother. Sitting on the stool at the mirror, she applied a peachy foundation that seemed to hold her down, to trap her, as if we never would have noticed what flew among us unless it was weighted and bound in its mask. Vaseline shined her eyebrows, mascara blackened her lashes until they swept down like feathers;  her eyes deepened until they shone from far away. Now I remember her hands, her poor hands, which, even then were old from scrubbing, whiter on the inside than they should have been, and hard, the first joints of her fingers, little fattened pads,  the nails filed to sharp points like old-fashioned ink pens, painted a jolly color. Her hands stood next to her face and wanted to be put away, prayed for the scrub bucket and brush to make them useful.  And, as I write, I forget the years I watched her  pull hairs like a witch from her chin, magnify every blotch—as if acid were thrown from the inside. But once a year my mother  rose in her white silk slip, not the slave of the house, the woman, took the ironed dress from the hanger—  allowing me to stand on the bed, so that  my face looked directly into her face,  and hold the garment away from her  as she pulled it down.\n	'acid':242 'allow':275 'among':109 'appli':87 'away':142,206,295 'beauti':13 'bed':281 'belong':69 'black':26 'blacken':125 'blotch':239 'bound':116 'braid':40 'brush':213 'bucket':211 'care':43 'chin':236 'christma':1 'color':193 'cornsilk':30 'costum':23 'crown':61 'dead':72 'deepen':136 'direct':287 'dress':5,271 'eleg':58 'eve':2 'even':152 'everi':238 'eye':135 'eyebrow':123 'face':200,285,290 'far':141 'fashion':187 'fatten':176 'feather':133 'file':180 'finger':174 'first':170 'fix':48 'flew':108 'forget':223 'foundat':90 'garment':294 'grandmoth':78 'hair':27,230 'hand':44,46,147,150,195 'hanger':274 'hard':168 'hip':34 'hold':94,292 'hous':265 'huge':66 'impress':10 'ink':188 'insect':67 'insid':161,247 'iron':270 'joint':171 'jolli':192 'lash':127 'like':21,65,132,184,231 'littl':175 'live':77 'look':286 'magnifi':237 'make':215 'mascara':124 'mask':119 'mirror':85 'mother':4,7,73,253 'nail':179 'nape':52 'neck':55 'never':103 'next':197 'notic':106 'old':155,186 'old-fashion':185 'one':36 'pad':177 'paint':190 'past':32 'peachi':89 'pen':189 'pin':64 'plait':24 'point':183 'poor':149 'pray':207 'pull':229,300 'put':18,205 'rememb':145 'rope':38 'rope-thick':37 'rose':254 'scrub':157,210 'seem':92 'sharp':182 'shine':121 'shone':139 'silk':258 'sit':79 'slave':262 'slick':28 'slip':259 'stand':278 'stiff':56 'stood':196 'stool':82 'swept':130 'thick':39 'thrown':244 'took':268 'tortois':63 'trap':98 'turn':41 'unless':111 'us':110 'use':217 'vaselin':120 'want':202 'watch':227 'weight':114 'white':257 'whiter':158 'witch':233 'woman':267 'would':104 'write':221 'year':16,225,251
735	St. Peter Claver	20		\nEvery town with black Catholics has a St. Peter Claver’s.  My first was nursery school. Miss Maturin made us fold our towels in a regulation square and nap on army cots. No mother questioned; no child sassed. In blue pleated skirts, pants, and white shirts, we stood in line to use the open toilets and conserved light by walking in darkness. Unsmiling, mostly light-skinned, we were the children of the middle class, preparing to take our parents’ places in a world that would demand we fold our hands and wait. They said it was good for us, the bowl of soup, its pasty whiteness; I learned to swallow and distrust my senses. On holy cards St. Peter’s face is olive-toned, his hair near kinky; I thought he was one of us who pass between the rich and poor, the light and dark. Now I read he was “a Spanish Jesuit priest who labored for the salvation of the African Negroes and the abolition of the slave trade.” I was tricked again, robbed of my patron, and left with a debt to another white man.\n	'abolit':172 'african':168 'anoth':191 'armi':34 'black':7 'blue':43 'bowl':105 'card':121 'cathol':8 'child':40 'children':74 'class':78 'claver':3,13 'conserv':60 'cot':35 'dark':65,151 'debt':189 'demand':90 'distrust':116 'everi':4 'face':125 'first':16 'fold':24,92 'good':101 'hair':131 'hand':94 'holi':120 'jesuit':159 'kinki':133 'labor':162 'learn':112 'left':186 'light':61,69,149 'light-skin':68 'line':53 'made':22 'man':193 'maturin':21 'middl':77 'miss':20 'most':67 'mother':37 'nap':32 'near':132 'negro':169 'nurseri':18 'oliv':128 'olive-ton':127 'one':138 'open':57 'pant':46 'parent':83 'pass':142 'pasti':109 'patron':184 'peter':2,12,123 'place':84 'pleat':44 'poor':147 'prepar':79 'priest':160 'question':38 'read':154 'regul':29 'rich':145 'rob':181 'said':98 'salvat':165 'sass':41 'school':19 'sens':118 'shirt':49 'skin':70 'skirt':45 'slave':175 'soup':107 'spanish':158 'squar':30 'st':1,11,122 'stood':51 'swallow':114 'take':81 'thought':135 'toilet':58 'tone':129 'towel':26 'town':5 'trade':176 'trick':179 'unsmil':66 'us':23,103,140 'use':55 'wait':96 'walk':63 'white':48,110,192 'world':87 'would':89
736	The Weakness	20		\nThat time my grandmother dragged me through the perfume aisles at Saks, she held me up  by my arm, hissing, “Stand up,” through clenched teeth, her eyes bright as a dog’s cornered in the light. She said it over and over, as if she were Jesus, and I were dead. She had been solid as a tree, a fur around her neck, a light-skinned matron whose car was parked, who walked on swirling marble and passed through brass openings—in 1945. There was not even a black elevator operator at Saks. The saleswoman had brought velvet  leggings to lace me in, and cooed, as if in the service of all grandmothers.  My grandmother had smiled, but not  hungrily, not like my mother who hated them, but wanted to please,  and they had smiled back, as if they were wearing wooden collars.  When my legs gave out, my grandmother  dragged me up and held me like God  holds saints by the roots of the hair. I begged her to believe I couldn’t help it. Stumbling,  her face white with sweat, she pushed me through the crowd, rushing away from those eyes  that saw through  her clothes, under her skin, all the way down  to the transparent  genes confessing.\n	'1945':86 'aisl':12 'arm':21 'around':63 'away':193 'back':139 'beg':171 'believ':174 'black':92 'brass':83 'bright':30 'brought':100 'car':72 'clench':26 'cloth':201 'collar':146 'confess':213 'coo':108 'corner':35 'couldn':176 'crowd':191 'dead':53 'dog':33 'drag':7,154 'elev':93 'even':90 'eye':29,196 'face':182 'fur':62 'gave':150 'gene':212 'god':161 'grandmoth':6,116,118,153 'hair':169 'hate':129 'held':16,158 'help':178 'hiss':22 'hold':162 'hungrili':123 'jesus':49 'lace':104 'leg':102,149 'light':38,68 'light-skin':67 'like':125,160 'marbl':79 'matron':70 'mother':127 'neck':65 'open':84 'oper':94 'park':74 'pass':81 'perfum':11 'pleas':134 'push':187 'root':166 'rush':192 'said':40 'saint':163 'sak':14,96 'saleswoman':98 'saw':198 'servic':113 'skin':69,204 'smile':120,138 'solid':57 'stand':23 'stumbl':180 'sweat':185 'swirl':78 'teeth':27 'time':4 'transpar':211 'tree':60 'velvet':101 'walk':76 'want':132 'way':207 'weak':2 'wear':144 'white':183 'whose':71 'wooden':145
737	A Note on My Son’s Face	20		\nI. Tonight, I look, thunderstruck at the gold head of my grandchild.  Almost asleep, he buries his feet  between my thighs; his little straw eyes close in the near dark. I smell the warmth of his raw  slightly foul breath, the new death  waiting to rot inside him. Our breaths equalize our heartbeats;  every muscle of the chest uncoils,  the arm bones loosen in the nest  of nerves. I think of the peace  of walking through the house, pointing to the name of this, the name of that, an educator of a new man. Mother. Grandmother. Wise Snake-woman who will show the way;  Spider-woman whose black tentacles hold him precious. Or will tear off his head,  her teeth over the little husband, the small fist clotted in trust at her breast. This morning, looking at the face of his father, I remembered how, an infant, his face was too dark,  nose too broad, mouth too wide. I did not look in that mirror and see the face that could save me from my own darkness. Did he, looking in my eye, see what I turned from: my own dark grandmother bending over gladioli in the field, her shaking black hand defenseless  at the shining cock of flower? I wanted that face to die, to be reborn in the face of a white child. I wanted the soul to stay the same,  for I loved to death, to damnation and God-death,  the soul that broke out of me. I crowed: My Son! My Beautiful!  But when I peeked in the basket,  I saw the face of a black man. Did I bend over his nose and straighten it with my fingers  like a vine growing the wrong way?  Did he feel my hand in malice? Generations we prayed and fucked  for this light child, the shining god of the second coming;  we bow down in shame and carry the children of the past  in our wallets, begging forgiveness. II. A picture in a book, a lynching. The bland faces of men who watch  a Christ go up in flames, smiling,  as if he were a hooked fish, a felled antelope, some wild thing tied to boards and burned.  His charring body gives off light—a halo burns out of him. His face scorched featureless; the hair matted to the scalp like feathers. One man stands with his hand on his hip,  another with his arm slung over the shoulder of a friend,  as if this moment were large enough  to hold affection. III. How can we wake from a dream we are born into, that shines around us,  the terrible bright air? Having awakened, having seen our own bloody hands,  how can we ask forgiveness, bring before our children the real  monster of their nightmares? The worst is true. Everything you did not want to know. \n	'affect':434 'air':454 'almost':20 'anoth':414 'antelop':372 'arm':68,417 'around':449 'ask':466 'asleep':21 'awaken':456 'basket':273 'beauti':266 'beg':339 'bend':202,284 'black':117,210,280 'bland':350 'bloodi':461 'board':378 'bodi':383 'bone':69 'book':346 'born':445 'bow':325 'breast':142 'breath':47,57 'bright':453 'bring':468 'broad':164 'broke':257 'buri':23 'burn':380,389 'carri':330 'char':382 'chest':65 'child':234,316 'children':332,471 'christ':357 'close':33 'clot':137 'cock':216 'come':323 'could':180 'crow':262 'damnat':249 'dark':37,161,186,200 'death':50,247,253 'defenseless':212 'die':224 'dream':442 'educ':97 'enough':431 'equal':58 'everi':61 'everyth':482 'eye':32,192 'face':7,148,158,178,222,230,277,351,394 'father':151 'feather':404 'featureless':396 'feel':303 'feet':25 'fell':371 'field':207 'finger':293 'fish':369 'fist':136 'flame':361 'flower':218 'forgiv':340,467 'foul':46 'friend':424 'fuck':312 'generat':308 'give':384 'gladioli':204 'go':358 'god':252,319 'god-death':251 'gold':15 'grandchild':19 'grandmoth':103,201 'grow':297 'hair':398 'halo':388 'hand':211,305,410,462 'head':16,127 'heartbeat':60 'hip':413 'hold':119,433 'hook':368 'hous':85 'husband':133 'ii':341 'iii':435 'infant':156 'insid':54 'know':488 'larg':430 'light':315,386 'like':294,403 'littl':30,132 'look':11,145,171,189 'loosen':70 'love':245 'lynch':348 'malic':307 'man':101,281,406 'mat':399 'men':353 'mirror':174 'moment':428 'monster':474 'morn':144 'mother':102 'mouth':165 'muscl':62 'name':89,93 'near':36 'nerv':75 'nest':73 'new':49,100 'nightmar':477 'nose':162,287 'note':2 'one':405 'past':335 'peac':80 'peek':270 'pictur':343 'point':86 'pray':310 'precious':121 'raw':44 'real':473 'reborn':227 'rememb':153 'rot':53 'save':181 'saw':275 'scalp':402 'scorch':395 'second':322 'see':176,193 'seen':458 'shake':209 'shame':328 'shine':215,318,448 'shoulder':421 'show':110 'slight':45 'slung':418 'small':135 'smell':39 'smile':362 'snake':106 'snake-woman':105 'son':5,264 'soul':238,255 'spider':114 'spider-woman':113 'stand':407 'stay':240 'straighten':289 'straw':31 'tear':124 'teeth':129 'tentacl':118 'terribl':452 'thigh':28 'thing':375 'think':77 'thunderstruck':12 'tie':376 'tonight':9 'true':481 'trust':139 'turn':196 'uncoil':66 'us':450 'vine':296 'wait':51 'wake':439 'walk':82 'wallet':338 'want':220,236,486 'warmth':41 'watch':355 'way':112,300 'white':233 'whose':116 'wide':167 'wild':374 'wise':104 'woman':107,115 'worst':479 'wrong':299
738	Black Boys Play the Classics	20		\nThe most popular “act” in Penn Station is the three black kids in ratty  sneakers & T-shirts playing two violins and a cello—Brahms.  White men in business suits have already dug into their pockets  as they pass and they toss in  a dollar or two without stopping.  Brown men in work-soiled khakis  stand with their mouths open,  arms crossed on their bellies  as if they themselves have always  wanted to attempt those bars.  One white boy, three, sits cross-legged in front of his idols—in ecstasy— their slick, dark faces, their thin, wiry arms, who must begin to look like angels! Why does this trembling pull us?

739	Passing	20		\nA professor invites me to his “Black Lit” class; they’re reading Larson’s Passing. One of the black students says, “Sometimes light-skinned blacks think they can fool other blacks, but I can always tell,” looking right through me. After I tell them I am black, I ask the class, “Was I passing when I was just sitting here, before I told you?” A white woman shakes her head desperately, as if I had deliberately deceived her. She keeps examining my face, then turning away as if she hopes I’ll disappear. Why presume “passing” is based on what I leave out and not what she fills in? In one scene in the book, in a restaurant, she’s “passing,” though no one checked her at the door— “Hey, you black?” My father, who looked white, told me this story: every year when he’d go to get his driver’s license, the man at the window filling out the form would ask, “White or black?” pencil poised, without looking up. My father wouldn’t pass, but he might use silence to trap a devil. When he didn’t speak, the man would look up at my father’s face. “What did he write?” my father quizzed me.\n	'alway':37 'ask':51,166 'away':88 'base':100 'black':8,20,27,33,49,134,169 'book':117 'check':127 'class':10,53 'd':148 'deceiv':79 'deliber':78 'desper':73 'devil':188 'didn':191 'disappear':95 'door':131 'driver':153 'everi':144 'examin':83 'face':85,203 'father':136,176,201,209 'fill':110,161 'fool':31 'form':164 'get':151 'go':149 'head':72 'hey':132 'hope':92 'invit':4 'keep':82 'larson':14 'leav':104 'licens':155 'light':25 'light-skin':24 'lit':9 'll':94 'look':39,138,173,197 'man':157,195 'might':182 'one':17,113,126 'pass':1,16,56,98,123,179 'pencil':170 'pois':171 'presum':97 'professor':3 'quizz':210 're':12 'read':13 'restaur':120 'right':40 'say':22 'scene':114 'shake':70 'silenc':184 'sit':61 'skin':26 'sometim':23 'speak':193 'stori':143 'student':21 'tell':38,45 'think':28 'though':124 'told':65,140 'trap':186 'turn':87 'use':183 'white':68,139,167 'window':160 'without':172 'woman':69 'would':165,196 'wouldn':177 'write':207 'year':145
740	Not Forgotten	20		\nI love the way the black ants use their dead. They carry them off like warriors on their steel backs. They spend hours struggling, lifting, dragging (it is not grisly as it would be for us, to carry them back to be eaten), so that every part will be of service. I think of my husband at his father’s grave— the grass had closed over the headstone, and the name had disappeared. He took out  his pocket knife and cut the grass away, he swept it with his handkerchief to make it clear. “Is this the way we’ll be forgotten?” And he bent down over the grave and wept. \n	'ant':9 'away':86 'back':22,42 'bent':107 'black':8 'carri':14,40 'clear':96 'close':67 'cut':83 'dead':12 'disappear':75 'drag':28 'eaten':45 'everi':48 'father':61 'forgotten':2,104 'grass':65,85 'grave':63,111 'grisli':32 'handkerchief':92 'headston':70 'hour':25 'husband':58 'knife':81 'lift':27 'like':17 'll':102 'love':4 'make':94 'name':73 'part':49 'pocket':80 'servic':53 'spend':24 'steel':21 'struggl':26 'swept':88 'think':55 'took':77 'us':38 'use':10 'warrior':18 'way':6,100 'wept':113 'would':35

742	The Search Party	297		\nI wondered if the others felt as heroic and as safe: my unmangled family   slept while I slid uncertain feet ahead   behind my flashlight’s beam. Stones, thick roots as twisted as   a ruined body, what did I fear? I hoped my batteries had eight more lives than the lost child. I feared I’d find something. Reader, by now you must be sure   you know just where we are,   deep in symbolic woods.   Irony, self-accusation,   someone else’s suffering.   The search is that of art. You’re wrong, though it’s   an intelligent mistake.   There was a real lost child.   I don’t want to swaddle it   in metaphor. I’m just a journalist who can’t believe in objectivity.   I’m in these poems because I’m in my life.   But I digress. A man four volunteers   to the left of me   made the discovery. We circled in like waves returning to the parent shock. You’ve read this far, you might as well   have been there too. Your eyes accuse   me of false chase. Come off it, you’re the one who thought it wouldn’t   matter what we found. Though we came with lights and tongues thick in our heads, the issue was a human life. The child was still alive. Admit you’re glad.\n	'accus':81,178 'admit':221 'ahead':24 'aliv':220 'art':91 'batteri':46 'beam':29 'behind':25 'believ':124 'bodi':38 'came':201 'chase':182 'child':54,106,217 'circl':154 'come':183 'd':58 'deep':74 'digress':140 'discoveri':152 'eight':48 'els':83 'eye':177 'fals':181 'famili':17 'far':167 'fear':42,56 'feet':23 'felt':9 'find':59 'flashlight':27 'found':198 'four':143 'glad':224 'head':209 'heroic':11 'hope':44 'human':214 'intellig':99 'ironi':78 'issu':211 'journalist':120 'know':69 'left':147 'life':137,215 'light':203 'like':156 'live':50 'lost':53,105 'm':117,128,134 'made':150 'man':142 'matter':195 'metaphor':115 'might':169 'mistak':100 'must':65 'object':126 'one':189 'other':8 'parent':161 'parti':3 'poem':131 're':93,187,223 'read':165 'reader':61 'real':104 'return':158 'root':32 'ruin':37 'safe':14 'search':2,87 'self':80 'self-accus':79 'shock':162 'slept':18 'slid':21 'someon':82 'someth':60 'still':219 'stone':30 'suffer':85 'sure':67 'swaddl':112 'symbol':76 'thick':31,206 'though':95,199 'thought':191 'tongu':205 'twist':34 'uncertain':22 'unmangl':16 've':164 'volunt':144 'want':110 'wave':157 'well':171 'wonder':5 'wood':77 'wouldn':193 'wrong':94
743	Too Many Daves	298		\nDid I ever tell you that Mrs. McCave Had twenty-three sons and she named them all Dave? Well, she did.   And that wasn't a smart thing to do. You see, when she wants one and calls out, "Yoo-Hoo! Come into the house, Dave!" she doesn't get one. All twenty-three Daves of hers come on the run! This makes things quite difficult at the McCaves' As you can imagine, with so many Daves. And often she wishes that, when they were born, She had named one of them Bodkin Van Horn And one of them Hoos-Foos.   And one of them Snimm. And one of them Hot-Shot.   And one Sunny Jim. And one of them Shadrack.   And one of them Blinkey. And one of them Stuffy.   And one of them Stinkey. Another one Putt-Putt.   Another one Moon Face. Another one Marvin O'Gravel Balloon Face. And one of them Ziggy.   And one Soggy Muff. One Buffalo Bill.   And one Biffalo Buff. And one of them Sneepy.   And one Weepy Weed. And one Paris Garters.   And one Harris Tweed.

745	The Snake	297		\nA snake is the love of a thumb  and forefinger. Other times, an arm that has swallowed a bicep. The air behind this one  is like a knot in a child’s shoelace come undone while you were blinking. It is bearing something away.  What? What time  does the next snake leave? This one’s tail is ravelling  into its burrow— a rosary returned to a purse.

746	The Waste Carpet	297		\nNo day is right for the apocalypse, if you ask a housewife in Talking Rock, Georgia, or maybe Hop River, Connecticut. She is opening a plastic bag. A grotesque parody of the primeval muck starts oozing out. And behold, the plastic bag is magic; there is no closing it. Soap in unsoftened water, sewage, asbestos coiled like vermicelli, Masonite shavings, a liquefied lifetime subscription to The New York Times delivered all at once. Empty body stockings, limp, forlorn, like collapsed lungs. A blithering slur  of face creams, an army of photocopies  travelling on its stomach of acronyms,  tooth paste tubes wrung rigid and dry.  Also, two hundred and one tons of crumpled bumpers wrapped in insurance  claims, slag, coal dust, plastic trimmings,  industrial excrementa. Lake Erie is returning  our gifts.        At first she thought she had won  something. Now it slithers through the house,  out windows, down the street, spreading  everywhere but heading, mostly, west.  Maybe heading is the wrong word, implying shape and choice. It took the shape of the landscape it rippled across like the last blanket. And it went west because the way lay open  once again: not the same fecund rug the earth grew when white people scraped  their first paths to the Pacific across the waves of the inland grasses. Outside Ravenswood, West Virginia,  abandoned cars shine in the sun like beetlebacks. The ore it took to make the iron it took to make the steel  it took to make the cars, that ore would remember the glaciers if it could.  Now comes another grinding, but not— thanks to our new techniques—so slow.  The amiable cars wait stilly in their pasture.  Three Edsels forage in the southeast corner  like bishops of a ruined church. There are Fords and Dodges, a Mercury  on blocks, four Darts and a Pierce Arrow, a choir of silenced Chevrolets. And, showing their lapsed trademarks  and proud grilles to a new westward  expansion, two Hudsons, a LaSalle and a DeSoto.        I was hoping to describe the colors of this industrial autumn— rust, a faded purple like the dusty skin of a Concord grape, flaking moss- green paint with primer peeking  blandly through, the garish macho reds  insurance companies punish, the greys  (opaque) and silvers (bright), the snob colors  (e.g. British Racing Green), the two-tone  combinations time will spurn like roadkill (1957: pink and grey), cornflower blue, naval blue, royal blue, stark blue, true blue, the blacker blue the diver sees beneath him when he plumbs thirty feet— but now they are all covered, rolling and churning in the last accident, like bubbles in lava. And now my Cincinnati—the hills  above the river, the lawn that drained toward Ricwood Ave. like a small valley of uncles, the sultry river musk that slid like a compromising note through my bedroom window— and indeed all Cincinnati seethes. The vats at Proctor & Gamble cease their slick congealing, and my beloved birthplace is but another whorl of dirt. Up north near Lebanon and Troy and Rosewood, the corn I skulked in as a boy lays back its ears like a shamed dog.  Hair along the sow’s spine rises. The Holstein pivots his massive head toward where the barn stood; the spreading stain he sees is his new owner. What we imagined was the fire-storm, or, failing that, the glacier. Or we hoped we’d get off easy, losing only California. With the seismologists and mystics we say the last California ridge crumble into the ocean. And we were read with elegies: O California, sportswear and defense contracts, gasses that induce deference, high school girls with their own cars, we wanted to love you without pain. O California, when you were moored to us like a vast splinter of melon, like a huge and garish gondola, then we were happier, although we showed it by easy contempt. But now you are lost at sea, your cargo of mudslides and Chardonnays lost, the prints of the old movies lost, the thick unlighted candles of the redwoods snuffed in advance. On the ocean floor they lie like hands of a broken clock. O California, here we come, quoting Ecclesiastes, ruinous with self-knowledge. Meanwhile, because the muck won’t stop for lamentation, Kansas succumbs. Drawn down by anklets of DDT, the jayhawk circles lower and lower  while the sludge moils and crests. Now we are about to lose our voices we remember that tomorrow is our echo.  O the old songs, the good days: bad faith and civil disobedience, sloppy scholarship and tooth decay.  Now the age of footnotes is ours. Ibid, ibid, ibid, ibid, ibid. While the rivers thickened and fish  rose like vomit, the students of water  stamped each fish with its death date.  Don’t let a chance like this go by,  they thought, though it went by  as everything went by—towers  of water flecked by a confetti  of topsoil, clucked tongues, smug  prayers. What we paid too much for  and too little attention to, our very lives, all jumbled now and far too big in aggregate  to understand or mourn, goes by, and all our eloquence places its weight on the spare word goodbye.\n	'1957':396 'abandon':223 'accid':435 'acronym':100 'across':178,212 'advanc':681 'age':769 'aggreg':853 'along':525 'also':108 'although':644 'amiabl':274 'anklet':720

747	Eyes:	297		\nthe only parts of the body the same   size at birth as they’ll always be.   “That’s why all babies are beautiful,”   Thurber used to say as he grew   blind—not dark, he’d go on   to explain, but floating in a pale   light always, a kind of candlelit   murk from a sourceless light.   He needed dark to see: for a while he drew on black   paper with white pastel chalk   but it grew worse. Light bored   into his eyes but where did it go?   Into a sea of phosphenes, along the wet fuse of some dead   nerve, it hid everywhere and couldn’t   be found. I’ve used up three guesses, all of them right. It’s like scuba diving, going down   into the black cone-tip that dives   farther than I can, though I dive   closer all the time.\n	'along':93 'alway':16,47 'babi':22 'beauti':24 'birth':12 'black':68,128 'blind':32 'bodi':7 'bore':79 'candlelit':51 'chalk':73 'closer':141 'cone':130 'cone-tip':129 'couldn':105 'd':36 'dark':34,59 'dead':99 'dive':123,133,140 'drew':66 'everywher':103 'explain':40 'eye':1,82 'farther':134 'float':42 'found':108 'fuse':96 'go':37,87,124 'grew':31,76 'guess':114 'hid':102 'kind':49 'light':46,56,78 'like':121 'll':15 'murk':52 'need':58 'nerv':100 'pale':45 'paper':69 'part':4 'pastel':72 'phosphen':92 'right':118 'say':28 'scuba':122 'sea':90 'see':61 'size':10 'sourceless':55 'though':138 'three':113 'thurber':25 'time':144 'tip':131 'use':26,111 've':110 'wet':95 'white':71 'wors':77
748	On A Diet	297		\nThe ruth of soups and balm of sauces I renounce equally. What Rorschach saw in ink I find in the buttery frizzle in the sauté pan, and I leave it behind,  and the sweet peat-smoke tang of bananas,  and cream in clots, and chocolate. I give away the satisfactions of food and take desire for food: I’ll be travelling light to the heaven of revisions. Why be  adipose: an expense, etc., in a waste, etc.? Something like the body of the poet’s work, with its pale shadows, begins to pare and replace the poet’s body, and isn’t it time?  \n	'adipos':74 'away':52 'balm':9 'banana':43 'begin':95 'behind':34 'bodi':85,103 'butteri':24 'chocol':49 'clot':47 'cream':45 'desir':59 'diet':3 'equal':14 'etc':77,81 'expens':76 'find':21 'food':56,61 'frizzl':25 'give':51 'heaven':69 'ink':19 'isn':105 'leav':32 'light':66 'like':83 'll':63 'pale':93 'pan':29 'pare':97 'peat':39 'peat-smok':38 'poet':88,101 'renounc':13 'replac':99 'revis':71 'rorschach':16 'ruth':5 'satisfact':54 'sauc':11 'sauté':28 'saw':17 'shadow':94 'smoke':40 'someth':82 'soup':7 'sweet':37 'take':58 'tang':41 'time':108 'travel':65 'wast':80 'work':90

750	A Happy Childhood	297		\nMy mother stands at the screen door, laughing.   “Out out damn Spot,” she commands our silly dog.   I wonder what this means. I rise into adult air like a hollyhock, I’m so proud to be loved   like this. The air is tight to my nervous body. I use new clothes and shoes the way the corn-studded   soil around here uses nitrogen, giddily. Ohio, Ohio, Ohio. Often I sing to myself all day like a fieldful of August   insects, just things I whisper, really, a trance in sneakers. I’m learning to read from my mother and soon I’ll go to school, I hate it when anyone dies or leaves and the air                   goes slack around my body and I have to hug myself, a cloud, an imaginary friend, the stream in the road- side park. I love to be called for dinner.   Spot goes out and I go in and the lights in the kitchen go on and the dark, which also has a body like a cloud’s, leans lightly against the house. Tomorrow I’ll find the sweatstains it left, little grey smudges. .       .       .        Here’s a sky no higher than a streetlamp, and a stack of morning papers cinched by wire.   It’s 4:00 A.M. A stout dog, vaguely beagle,   minces over the dry, fresh-fallen snow; and here’s our sleep-sodden paperboy   with his pliers, his bike, his matronly dog,   his unclouding face set for paper route like an alarm clock. Here’s a memory in the making, for this could be the morning   he doesn’t come home and his parents   two hours later drive his route until they find him asleep, propped against a streetlamp, his papers all delivered and his dirty paper- satchel slack, like an emptied lung, and he blur-faced and iconic in the morning air rinsing itself a paler and paler blue through which a last few dandruff-flecks   of snow meander casually down.   The dog squeaks in out of the dark, snuffling me too me too. And here he goes   home to memory, and to hot chocolate on which no crinkled skin forms like infant ice, and to the long and ordinary day, school, two triumphs and one severe humiliation on the playground, the past already growing its scabs, the busride home, dinner, and evening leading to sleep like the slide that will spill him out, come June,   into the eye-reddening chlorine waters   of the municipal pool. Here he goes to bed. Kiss. Kiss. Teeth. Prayers. Dark. Dark.   Here the dog lies down by his bed,   and sighs and farts. Will he always be this skinny, chicken-bones?   He’ll remember like a prayer how his mother made breakfast for him every morning before he trudged out   to snip the papers free. Just as   his mother will remember she felt guilty never to wake up with him   to give him breakfast. It was Cream of Wheat they always or never had together. It turns out you are the story of your childhood   and you’re under constant revision,   like a lonely folktale whose invisible folks are all the selves you’ve been, lifelong,   shadows in fog, grey glimmers at dusk.   And each of these selves had a childhood it traded for love and grudged to give away,   now lost irretrievably, in storage   like a set of dishes from which no food, no Cream of Wheat, no rabbit in mustard   sauce, nor even a single raspberry,   can be eaten until the afterlife, which is only childhood in its last   disguise, all radiance or all humiliation,   and so it is forfeit a final time. In fact it was awful, you think, or why   should the piecework of grief be endless?   Only because death is, and likewise loss, which is not awful, but only breathtaking.   There’s no truth about your childhood,   though there’s a story, yours to tend, like a fire or garden. Make it a good one,   since you’ll have to live it out, and all its revisions, so long as you all shall live, for they shall be gathered to your deathbed,   and they’ll have known to what you and they would come, and this one time they’ll weep for you. The map in the shopping center has an X signed “you are here.” A dream is like that.   In a dream you are never eighty, though   you may risk death by other means: you’re on a ledge and memory calls you   to jump, but a deft cop talks you in to a small, bright room, and snickers. And in a dream, you’re everyone somewhat,   but not wholly. I think I know how that works: for twenty-one years I had a father   and then I became a father, replacing him   but not really. Soon my sons will be fathers. Surely, that’s what middle-aged means,   being father and son to sons and father.   That a male has only one mother is another story, told wherever men weep wholly.   Though nobody’s replaced. In one dream   I’m leading a rope of children to safety, through a snowy farm. The farmer comes out   and I have to throw snowballs well to him   so we may pass. Even dreaming, I know he’s my father, at ease in his catcher’s   squat, and that the dream has revived   to us both an old unspoken fantasy: we’re a battery. I’m young, I’m brash,   I don’t know how to pitch but I can   throw a lamb chop past a wolf. And he can handle pitchers and control a game.   I look to him for a sign. I’d nod for anything. The damn thing is hard to grip without seams, and I don’t rely only on my live, young arm, but throw by all   the body I can get behind it, and it fluffs toward him no faster than the snow   in the dream drifts down. Nothing takes forever, but I know what the phrase means. The children grow more cold   and hungry and cruel to each other the longer the ball’s in the air, and it begins to melt. By the time it gets to him we’ll be   our waking ages, and each of us is himself   alone, and we all join hands and go. .       .       .        Toward dawn, rain explodes on the tin roof   like popcorn. The pale light is streaked by grey and that green you see just under the surface of water, a shimmer more than a color.   Time to dive back into sleep, as if into   happiness, that neglected discipline .... In those sixth-grade book reports you had to say if the book was optimistic   or not, and everyone looked at you the same way: how would he turn out?   He rolls in his sleep like an otter.   Uncle Ed has a neck so fat it’s funny, and on the way to work he pries the cap off a Pepsi. Damn rain didn’t cool one weary   thing for long; it’s gonna be a cooker. The boy sleeps with a thin chain of sweat   on his upper lip, as if waking itself,   becoming explicit, were hard work. Who knows if he’s happy or not?   A child is all the tools a child has,   growing up, who makes what he can.\n	'00':214 '4':213 'a.m':215 'adult':29 'afterlif':597 'age':830,1061

753	Minuscule Things	297		\nThere’s a crack in this glass so fine we can’t see it,  and in the blue eye of the candleflame’s needle  there’s a dark fleck, a speck of imperfection that could contain, like a microchip, an epic treatise on beauty, except it’s in the eye of the beheld.  And at the base of our glass there’s nothing so big as a tiny puddle, but an ooze, a viscous  patina like liquefied tarnish. It’s like a text so short it consists only of the author’s signature, which has to stand, like the future, for what might  have been: a novel, let’s say, thick with ambiguous life.  Its hero forgets his goal as he nears it, so that it’s like rain evaporating in the very sight of parched  Saharans on the desert floor. There, by chance, he meets  a thirsty and beautiful woman. What a small world! \n	'ambigu':115 'author':93 'base':59 'beauti':46,152 'beheld':55 'big':67 'blue':20 'candleflam':24 'chanc':146 'consist':89 'contain':38 'could':37 'crack':6 'dark':30 'desert':142 'epic':43 'evapor':132 'except':47 'eye':21,52 'fine':11 'fleck':31 'floor':143 'forget':119 'futur':102 'glass':9,62 'goal':121 'hero':118 'imperfect':35 'let':110 'life':116 'like':39,78,83,100,130 'liquefi':79 'meet':148 'microchip':41 'might':105 'minuscul':1 'near':124 'needl':26 'noth':65 'novel':109 'ooz':74 'parch':138 'patina':77 'puddl':71 'rain':131 'saharan':139 'say':112 'see':15 'short':87 'sight':136 'signatur':95 'small':156 'speck':33 'stand':99 'tarnish':80 'text':85 'thick':113 'thing':2 'thirsti':150 'tini':70 'treatis':44 'viscous':76 'woman':153 'world':157
754	Men at My Father’s Funeral	297		\nThe ones his age who shook my hand  on their way out sent fear along  my arm like heroin. These weren’t  men mute about their feelings, or what’s a body language for? And I, the glib one, who’d stood with my back to my father’s body and praised the heart that attacked him?  I’d made my stab at elegy, the flesh made word: the very spit in my mouth was sour with ruth and eloquence. What could be worse?  Silence, the anthem of my father’s  new country. And thus this babble,  like a dial tone, from our bodies. \n	'age':10 'along':21 'anthem':93 'arm':23 'attack':62 'babbl':103 'back':51 'bodi':38,56,110 'could':88 'countri':99 'd':47,65 'dial':106 'elegi':70 'eloqu':86 'father':4,54,96 'fear':20 'feel':33 'flesh':72 'funer':6 'glib':44 'hand':14 'heart':60 'heroin':25 'languag':39 'like':24,104 'made':66,73 'men':1,29 'mouth':80 'mute':30 'new':98 'one':8,45 'prais':58 'ruth':84 'sent':19 'shook':12 'silenc':91 'sour':82 'spit':77 'stab':68 'stood':48 'thus':101 'tone':107 'way':17 'weren':27 'word':74 'wors':90
755	The Bear at the Dump	297		\nAmidst the too much that we buy and throw   away and the far too much we wrap it in,   the bear found a few items of special interest—a honeydew rind, a used tampon,   the bone from a leg of lamb. He’d rock back   lightly onto his rear paws and slash open a plastic bag, and then his nose— jammed almost with a surfeit of rank and likely information, for he would pause— and then his whole dowsing snout would   insinuate itself a little way inside. By now he’d have hunched his weight   forward slightly, and then he’d snatch it back,   trailed by some tidbit in his teeth. He’d look   around. What a good boy am he. The guardian of the dump was used to this and not amused. “He’ll drag that shit   every which damn way,” he grumbled who’d dozed and scraped a pit to keep that shit   where the town paid to contain it. The others of us looked and looked. “City   folks like you don’t get to see this often,”   one year-round resident accused me. Some winter I’ll bring him down to learn   to love a rat working a length of subway   track. “Nope,” I replied. Just then the bear   decamped for the woods with a marl of grease   and slather in his mouth and on his snout,   picking up speed, not cute (nor had he been   cute before, slavering with greed, his weight   all sunk to his seated rump and his nose stuck   up to sift the rich and fetid air, shaped   like a huge, furry pear), but richly fed on the slow-simmering dump, and gone   into the bug-thick woods and anecdote. \n	'accus':191 'air':270 'almost':67 'amidst':6 'amus':138 'anecdot':295 'around':120 'away':15 'back':50,109 'bag':61 'bear':2,26,218 'bone':41 'boy':124 'bring':197 'bug':291 'bug-thick':290 'buy':12 'citi':175 'contain':166 'cute':241,246 'd':48,96,106,118,151 'damn':146 'decamp':219 'dows':84 'doze':152 'drag':141 'dump':5,131,285 'everi':144 'far':18 'fed':279 'fetid':269 'folk':176 'forward':101 'found':27 'furri':275 'get':181 'gone':287 'good':123 'greas':227 'greed':250 'grumbl':149 'guardian':128 'honeydew':35 'huge':274 'hunch':98 'inform':75 'insid':92 'insinu':87 'interest':33 'item':30 'jam':66 'keep':158 'lamb':46 'learn':201 'leg':44 'length':208 'light':51 'like':74,177,272 'littl':90 'll':140,196 'look':119,172,174 'love':203 'marl':225 'mouth':232 'much':9,20 'nope':212 'nose':65,261 'often':185 'one':186 'onto':52 'open':58 'other':169 'paid':164 'paus':79 'paw':55 'pear':276 'pick':237 'pit':156 'plastic':60 'rank':72 'rat':205 'rear':54 'repli':214 'resid':190 'rich':267,278 'rind':36 'rock':49 'round':189 'rump':258 'scrape':154 'seat':257 'see':183 'shape':271 'shit':143,160 'sift':265 'simmer':284 'slash':57 'slather':229 'slaver':248 'slight':102 'slow':283 'slow-simm':282 'snatch':107 'snout':85,236 'special':32 'speed':239 'stuck':262 'subway':210 'sunk':254 'surfeit':70 'tampon':39 'teeth':116 'thick':292 'throw':14 'tidbit':113 'town':163 'track':211 'trail':110 'us':171 'use':38,133 'way':91,147 'weight':100,252 'whole':83 'winter':194 'wood':222,293 'work':206 'would':78,86 'wrap':22 'year':188 'year-round':187

756	Well, You Needn’t	297		\nRather than hold his hands properly  arched off the keys, like cats with their backs up, Monk, playing block chords, hit the keys with his fingertips well  above his wrists, shoulders up, wrists down, scarce  room for the pencil, ground  freshly to a point, piano teachers love to poke into the palms of junior pianists with lazy hands. What easy villains these robotic  dullards are in their floral- print teaching dresses (can those mauve blurs be peonies?). The teachers’ plucky,  make-do wardrobes suggest, like the wan bloom of dust the couch exhaled  when I scrunched down to wait  for Mrs. Oxley, just how we value  them. She’d launch my predecessor  home and drink some lemonade,  then free me from the couch. The wisdom in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, where Monk grew up,  is that those names, Thelonious  Sphere, came later, but nobody’s  sure: he made his escape by turning himself into a genius in broad daylight while nobody  watched. Just a weird little black  kid one day and next thing anybody  knew he was inexplicable and gone. We don’t give lessons  in that. In fact it’s to stave off such desertions that we pay for lessons. It works for a while.  Think of all the time we spend  thinking about our kids. It’s Mrs. Oxley, the frump with a metronome, and Mr. Mote, the bad teacher and secret weeper,  we might think on, and everyone  we pay to tend our young, opaque  and truculent and terrified,  not yet ready to replace us,  or escape us, if that be the work. \n	'anybodi':179 'arch':11 'back':19 'bad':236 'black':172 'block':23 'bloom':93 'blur':79 'broad':163 'came':146 'carolina':135 'cat':16 'chord':24 'couch':97,128 'd':114 'day':175 'daylight':164 'desert':201 'dress':75 'drink':120 'dullard':68 'dust':95 'easi':64 'escap':155,265 'everyon':246 'exhal':98 'fact':194 'fingertip':30 'floral':72 'free':124 'fresh':45 'frump':228 'genius':161 'give':189 'gone':185 'grew':138 'ground':44 'hand':9,62 'hit':25 'hold':7 'home':118 'inexplic':183 'junior':58 'key':14,27 'kid':173,222 'knew':180 'later':147 'launch':115 'lazi':61 'lemonad':122 'lesson':190,206 'like':15,90 'littl':171 'love':51 'made':153 'make':86 'make-do':85 'mauv':78 'metronom':231 'might':242 'monk':21,137 'mote':234 'mount':133 'mr':233 'mrs':106,225 'name':143 'needn':3 'next':177 'nobodi':149,166 'north':134 'one':174 'opaqu':253 'oxley':107,226 'palm':56 'pay':204,248 'pencil':43 'peoni':81 'pianist':59 'piano':49 'play':22 'plucki':84 'point':48 'poke':53 'predecessor':117 'print':73 'proper':10 'rather':5 'readi':260 'replac':262 'robot':67 'rocki':132 'room':40 'scarc':39 'scrunch':101 'secret':239 'shoulder':35 'spend':218 'sphere':145 'stave':198 'suggest':89 'sure':151 'teach':74 'teacher':50,83,237 'tend':250 'terrifi':257 'theloni':144 'thing':178 'think':212,219,243 'time':216 'trucul':255 'turn':157 'us':263,266 'valu':111 'villain':65 'wait':104 'wan':92 'wardrob':88 'watch':167 'weeper':240 'weird':170 'well':1,31 'wisdom':130 'work':208,271 'wrist':34,37 'yet':259 'young':252
757	John Henry	95		\nWhen John Henry was a little tiny baby Sitting on his mama's knee, He picked up a hammer and a little piece of steel Saying, "Hammer's going to be the death of me, Lord, Lord,     Hammer's going to be the death of me." John Henry was a man just six feet high, Nearly two feet and a half across his breast. He'd hammer with a nine-pound hammer all day And never get tired and want to rest, Lord, Lord,     And never get tired and want to rest. John Henry went up on the mountain And he looked one eye straight up its side. The mountain was so tall and John Henry was so small, He laid down his hammer and he cried, "Lord, Lord,"     He laid down his hammer and he cried. John Henry said to his captain, "Captain, you go to town, Bring me back a TWELVE-pound hammer, please, And I'll beat that steam drill down, Lord, Lord,     I'll beat that steam drill down." The captain said to John Henry, "I believe this mountain's sinking in." But John Henry said, "Captain, just you stand aside-- It's nothing but my hammer catching wind, Lord, Lord,     It's nothing but my hammer catching wind." John Henry said to his shaker, "Shaker, boy, you better start to pray, 'Cause if my TWELVE-pound hammer miss that little piece of steel, Tomorrow'll be your burying day, Lord, Lord,     Tomorrow'll be your burying day." John Henry said to his captain, "A man is nothing but a man, But before I let your steam drill beat me down, I'd die with a hammer in my hand, Lord, Lord,     I'd die with a hammer in my hand." The man that invented the steam drill, He figured he was mighty high and fine, But John Henry sunk the steel down fourteen feet While the steam drill only made nine, Lord, Lord,     The steam drill only made nine. John Henry hammered on the right-hand side. Steam drill kept driving on the left. John Henry beat that steam drill down. But he hammered his poor heart to death, Lord, Lord,     He hammered his poor heart to death. Well, they carried John Henry down the tunnel And they laid his body in the sand. Now every woman riding on a C and O train Says, "There lies my steel-driving man, Lord, Lord,     There lies my steel-driving man."\n	'across':64 'asid':199 'babi':10 'back':154 'beat':164,173,278,358 'believ':185 'better':227 'bodi':392 'boy':225 'breast':66 'bring':152 'buri':248,256 'c':402 'captain':146,147,179,195,263 'carri':382 'catch':206,216 'caus':231 'cri':130,140 'd':68,282,293 'day':77,249,257 'death':35,46,370,379 'die':283,294 'drill':167,176,277,307,328,336,350,361 'drive':352,412,421 'everi':397 'eye':107 'feet':56,60,324 'figur':309 'fine':315 'fourteen':323 'get':80,90 'go':31,42,149 'half':63 'hammer':21,29,40,69,75,127,137,159,205,215,237,286,297,342,365,374 'hand':289,300,347 'heart':368,377 'henri':2,5,50,97,119,142,183,193,219,259,318,341,357,384 'high':57,313 'invent':304 'john':1,4,49,96,118,141,182,192,218,258,317,340,356,383 'kept':351 'knee':16 'laid':124,134,390 'left':355 'let':274 'lie':408,417 'littl':8,24,240 'll':163,172,245,253 'look':105 'lord':38,39,86,87,131,132,169,170,208,209,250,251,290,291,332,333,371,372,414,415 'made':330,338 'mama':14 'man':53,265,270,302,413,422 'mighti':312 'miss':238 'mountain':102,113,187 'near':58 'never':79,89 'nine':73,331,339 'nine-pound':72 'noth':202,212,267 'o':404 'one':106 'pick':18 'piec':25,241 'pleas':160 'poor':367,376 'pound':74,158,236 'pray':230 'rest':85,95 'ride':399 'right':346 'right-hand':345 'said':143,180,194,220,260 'sand':395 'say':28,406 'shaker':223,224 'side':111,348 'sink':189 'sit':11 'six':55 'small':122 'stand':198 'start':228 'steam':166,175,276,306,327,335,349,360 'steel':27,243,321,411,420 'steel-driv':410,419 'straight':108 'sunk':319 'tall':116 'tini':9 'tire':81,91 'tomorrow':244,252 'town':151 'train':405 'tunnel':387 'twelv':157,235 'twelve-pound':156,234 'two':59 'want':83,93 'well':380 'went':98 'wind':207,217 'woman':398

776	Wynken, Blynken, and Nod	303		\nWynken, Blynken, and Nod one night     Sailed off in a wooden shoe-- Sailed on a river of crystal light,     Into a sea of dew. "Where are you going, and what do you wish?"     The old moon asked of the three. "We have come to fish for the herring fish That live in this beautiful sea; Nets of silver and gold have we!"                   Said Wynken,                   Blynken,                   And Nod. The old moon laughed and sang a song,     As they rocked in the wooden shoe, And the wind that sped them all night long     Ruffled the waves of dew. The little stars were the herring fish     That lived in that beautiful sea-- "Now cast your nets wherever you wish--     Never afeard are we!"     So cried the stars to the fishermen three:                   Wynken,                   Blynken,                   And Nod.All night long their nets they threw   To the stars in the twinkling foam---Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe,   Bringing the fishermen home;'T was all so pretty a sail it seemed   As if it could not be,And some folks thought 't was a dream they 'd dreamed   Of sailing that beautiful sea---   But I shall name you the fishermen three:                     Wynken,                     Blynken,                     And Nod.Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes,   And Nod is a little head,And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies   Is a wee one's trundle-bed.So shut your eyes while mother sings   Of wonderful sights that be,And you shall see the beautiful things   As you rock in the misty sea,   Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three:                     Wynken,                     Blynken,                     And Nod.\n	'afeard':122 'ask':41 'beauti':58,112,192,248 'blynken':2,6,69,134,203,207,266 'bring':159 'came':155 'cast':115 'come':47 'could':175 'cri':126 'crystal':22 'd':187 'dew':28,100 'dream':185,188 'eye':211,234 'fish':49,53,107 'fishermen':131,161,200,263 'foam':149 'folk':180 'go':32 'gold':64 'head':217 'herring':52,106 'home':162 'laugh':75 'light':23 'littl':102,210,216 'live':55,109 'long':95,138 'misti':255 'moon':40,74 'mother':236 'name':197 'net':60,117,140 'never':121 'night':10,94,137 'nod':4,8,71,213,268 'nod.all':136 'nod.wynken':205 'old':39,73,259 'one':9,229 'pretti':167 'river':20 'rock':82,252,261 'ruffl':96 'said':67 'sail':11,17,169,190,223 'sang':77 'sea':26,59,113,193,256 'see':246 'seem':171 'shall':196,245 'shoe':16,86,158,221,260 'shut':232 'sight':240 'silver':62 'sing':237 'sky':154,225 'song':79 'sped':91 'star':103,128,145 'thing':249 'thought':181 'three':44,132,201,264 'threw':142 'trundle-bed.so':231 'twinkl':148 'two':209 'wave':98 'wee':228 'wherev':118 'wind':89 'wish':37,120 'wonder':239 'wooden':15,85,157,220 'wynken':1,5,68,133,202,265
784	Morningside Heights, July	297		\nHaze. Three student violists boarding  a bus. A clatter of jackhammers. Granular light. A film of sweat for primer  and the heat for a coat of paint. A man and a woman on a bench:  she tells him he must be psychic, for how else could he sense, even before she knew,  that she’d need to call it off? A bicyclist  fumes by with a coach’s whistle clamped  hard between his teeth, shrilling like a teakettle  on the boil. I never meant, she says.  But I thought, he replies. Two cabs almost  collide; someone yells fuck in Farsi.  I’m sorry, she says. The comforts  of loneliness fall in like a bad platoon.  The sky blurs—there’s a storm coming  up or down. A lank cat slinks liquidly  around a corner. How familiar it feels to feel strange, hollower than a bassoon. A rill of chill air in the leaves. A car alarm. Hail. \n	'air':153 'alarm':159 'almost':97 'around':135 'bad':117 'bassoon':148 'bench':38 'bicyclist':65 'blur':121 'board':8 'boil':84 'bus':10 'cab':96 'call':61 'car':158 'cat':132 'chill':152 'clamp':73 'clatter':12 'coach':70 'coat':28 'collid':98 'come':126 'comfort':110 'corner':137 'could':49 'd':58 'els':48 'even':52 'fall':113 'familiar':139 'farsi':103 'feel':141,143 'film':18 'fuck':101 'fume':66 'granular':15 'hail':160 'hard':74 'haze':4 'heat':25 'height':2 'hollow':145 'jackhamm':14 'juli':3 'knew':55 'lank':131 'leav':156 'light':16 'like':79,115 'liquid':134 'loneli':112 'm':105 'man':32 'meant':87 'morningsid':1 'must':43 'need':59 'never':86 'paint':30 'platoon':118 'primer':22 'psychic':45 'repli':94 'rill':150 'say':89,108 'sens':51 'shrill':78 'sky':120 'slink':133 'someon':99 'sorri':106 'storm':125 'strang':144 'student':6 'sweat':20 'teakettl':81 'teeth':77 'tell':40 'thought':92 'three':5 'two':95 'violist':7 'whistl':72 'woman':35 'yell':100

780	The Closet	305		\nHere not long enough after the hospital happened   I find her closet lying empty and stop my play   And go in and crane up at three blackwire hangers   Which quiver, airy, released. They appear to enjoy Their new distance, cognizance born of the absence   Of anything else. The closet has been cleaned out   Full-flush as surgeries where the hangers could be   Amiable scalpels though they just as well would be Themselves, in basements, glovelessly scraping uteri   But, here, pure, transfigured heavenward, they’re Birds, whose wingspans expand by excluding me. Their   Range is enlarged by loss. They’d leave buzzards Measly as moths: and the hatshelf is even higher!— As the sky over a prairie, an undotted desert where   Nothing can swoop sudden, crumple in secret. I’ve fled   At ambush, tag, age: six, must I face this, can I have my hide-and-seek hole back now please, the   Clothes, the thicket of shoes, where is it? Only   The hangers are at home here. Come heir to this   Rare element, fluent, their skeletal grace sings Of the ease with which they let go the dress, slip,   Housecoat or blouse, so absolvingly. Free, they fly Trim, triangular, augurs leapt ahead from some geometric   God who soars stripped (of flesh, it is said): catnip To a brat placated by model airplane kits kids My size lack motorskills for, I wind up glue-scabbed,   Pawing goo-goo fingernails, glaze skins fun to peer in as Frost-i-glass doors ... But the closet has no windows, Opaque or sheer: I must shut my eyes, shrink within   To peep into this wall. Soliciting sleep I’ll dream   Mother spilled and cold, unpillowed, the operating- Table cracked to goad delivery: its stirrups slack, Its forceps closed: by it I’ll see mobs of obstetrical   Personnel kneel proud, congratulatory, cooing And oohing and hold the dead infant up to the dead   Woman’s face as if for approval, the prompted Beholding, tears, a zoomshot kiss.

She knows who bears whom. In that momentary museum where memory occurs more accrue of those torturers’ pincers than lessened fingernails, eyes teased to a pulp, we beg for closeups.

783	Mingus in Diaspora	297		\nYou could say, I suppose, that he ate his way out,  like the prisoner who starts a tunnel with a spoon, or you could say he was one in whom nothing was lost,  who took it all in, or that he was big as a bus. He would say, and he did, in one of those blurred  melismatic slaloms his sentences ran—for all the music was in his speech: swift switches of tempo,  stop-time, double time (he could talk in 6/8), “I just ruined my body.” And there, Exhibit A,  it stood, that Parthenon of fat, the tenant voice  lifted, as we say, since words are a weight, and music.  Silence is lighter than air, for the air we know rises but to the edge of the atmosphere. You have to pick up The Bass, as Mingus called his, with audible capitals, and think of the slow years  the wood spent as a tree, which might well have been enough for wood, and think of the skill the bassmaker  carried without great thought of it from home  to the shop and back for decades, and know what bassists before you have played, and know how much of this is stored in The Bass like energy  in a spring and know how much you must coax out.  How easy it would be, instead, to pull a sword  from a stone. But what’s inside the bass wants out, the way one day you will. Religious stories are rich  in symmetry. You must release as much of this hoard  as you can, little by little, in perfect time, as the work of the body becomes a body of work. \n	'6/8':87 'air':121,124 'ate':11 'atmospher':134 'audibl':147 'back':188 'bass':141,209,241 'bassist':194 'bassmak':175 'becom':279 'big':46 'blur':60 'bodi':92,278,281 'bus':49 'call':144 'capit':148 'carri':176 'coax':221 'could':5,27,84 'day':247 'decad':190 'diaspora':3 'doubl':81 'easi':224 'edg':131 'energi':211 'enough':166 'exhibit':95 'fat':102 'great':178 'hoard':263 'home':183 'insid':239 'instead':228 'know':126,192,200,216 'lift':106 'lighter':119 'like':15,210 'littl':267,269 'lost':36 'melismat':61 'might':162 'mingus':1,143 'much':202,218,260 'music':69,116 'must':220,257 'noth':34 'one':31,57,246 'parthenon':100 'perfect':271 'pick':138 'play':198 'prison':17 'pull':230 'ran':65 'releas':258 'religi':250 'rich':253 'rise':127 'ruin':90 'say':6,28,52,109 'sentenc':64 'shop':186 'silenc':117 'sinc':110 'skill':173 'slalom':62 'slow':153 'speech':73 'spent':157 'spoon':24 'spring':214 'start':19 'stone':235 'stood':98 'stop':79 'stop-tim':78 'store':206 'stori':251 'suppos':8 'swift':74 'switch':75 'sword':232 'symmetri':255 'talk':85 'tempo':77 'tenant':104 'think':150,170 'thought':179 'time':80,82,272 'took':38 'tree':160 'tunnel':21 'voic':105 'want':242 'way':13,245 'weight':114 'well':163 'without':177 'wood':156,168 'word':111 'work':275,283 'would':51,226 'year':154
785	The Children	306		\nThe children are hiding among the raspberry canes.  They look big to one another, the garden small.  Already in their mouths this soft fruit  That lasts so briefly in the supermarket  Tastes like the past. The gritty wall,  Behind the veil of leaves, is hollow. There are yellow wasps inside it. The children know.  They know the wall is hard, although it hums. They know a lot and will not forget it soon. When did we forget? But we were never  Children, never found where they were hiding And hid with them, never followed  The wasp down into its nest With a fingertip that still tingles. We lie in bed at night, thinking about The future, always the future, always forgetting That it will be the past, hard and hollow,  Veiled and humming, soon enough. \n	'alreadi':20 'although':63 'alway':119,122 'among':7 'anoth':16 'bed':112 'behind':41 'big':13 'briefli':30 'cane':10 'children':2,4,55,84 'enough':137 'fingertip':105 'follow':96 'forget':73,79,123 'found':86 'fruit':26 'futur':118,121 'garden':18 'gritti':39 'hard':62,130 'hid':92 'hide':6,90 'hollow':47,132 'hum':65,135 'insid':52 'know':56,58,67 'last':28 'leav':45 'lie':110 'like':35 'look':12 'lot':69 'mouth':23 'nest':102 'never':83,85,95 'night':114 'one':15 'past':37,129 'raspberri':9 'small':19 'soft':25 'soon':75,136 'still':107 'supermarket':33 'tast':34 'think':115 'tingl':108 'veil':43,133 'wall':40,60 'wasp':51,98 'yellow':50
786	Dressing My Daughters	306		\nOne girl a full head taller Than the other—into their Sunday dresses.  First, the slip, hardly a piece of fabric,  Softly stitched and printed with a bud. I’m not their mother, and tangle, then untangle  The whole cloth—on backwards, have to grab it  Round their necks. But they know how to pull  Arms in, a reflex of being dressed, And also, a child’s faith. The mass of stuff  That makes the Sunday frocks collapses In my hands and finds its shape, only because  They understand the drape of it— These skinny keys to intricate locks.  The buttons are a problem For a surgeon. How would she connect  These bony valves and stubborn eyelets? The filmy dress revolves in my blind fingers.  The slots work one by one. And when they’re put together, Not like puppets or those doll-saints  That bring tears to true believers, But living children, somebody’s real daughters,  They do become more real. They say, “Stop it!” and “Give it back!”  And “I don’t want to!” They’ll kiss A doll’s hard features, whispering, “I’m sorry.” I know just why my mother  Used to worry. Your clothes don’t keep  You close—it’s nakedness. Clad in my boots and holster, I would roam with my six-gun buddies. We dealt fake death to one another, Fell and rolled in filth and rose, Grimy with wounds, then headed home. But Sunday ... what was that tired explanation  Given for wearing clothes that Scratched and shone and weighed like a slow hour?  That we should shine—in gratitude. So, I give that explanation, undressing them,  And wait for the result. After a day like Sunday, such a long one, When they lie down, half-dead, To be undone, they won’t help me. They cry, “It’s not my fault.” \n	'also':67 'anoth':233 'arm':59 'back':174 'backward':45 'becom':164 'believ':154 'blind':127 'boni':116 'boot':215 'bring':150 'bud':31 'buddi':226 'button':104 'child':69 'children':157 'clad':212 'close':208 'cloth':43,203,257 'collaps':81 'connect':114 'cri':311 'daughter':3,161 'day':288 'dead':301 'dealt':228 'death':230 'doll':147,185 'doll-saint':146 'drape':94 'dress':1,16,65,123 'explan':253,278 'eyelet':120 'fabric':24 'faith':71 'fake':229 'fault':316 'featur':188 'fell':234 'filmi':122 'filth':238 'find':86 'finger':128 'first':17 'frock':80 'full':7 'girl':5 'give':172,276 'given':254 'grab':48 'gratitud':273 'grimi':241 'gun':225 'half':300 'half-dead':299 'hand':84 'hard':20,187 'head':8,245 'help':308 'holster':217 'home':246 'hour':267 'intric':101 'keep':206 'key':99 'kiss':183 'know':55,194 'lie':297 'like':142,264,289 'live':156 'll':182 'lock':102 'long':293 'm':33,191 'make':77 'mass':73 'mother':36,198 'naked':211 'neck':52 'one':4,132,134,232,294 'piec':22 'print':28 'problem':107 'pull':58 'puppet':143 'put':139 're':138 'real':160,166 'reflex':62 'result':285 'revolv':124 'roam':220 'roll':236 'rose':240 'round':50 'saint':148 'say':168 'scratch':259 'shape':88 'shine':271 'shone':261 'six':224 'six-gun':223 'skinni':98 'slip':19 'slot':130 'slow':266 'soft':25 'somebodi':158 'sorri':192 'stitch':26 'stop':169 'stubborn':119 'stuff':75 'sunday':15,79,248,290 'surgeon':110 'taller':9 'tangl':38 'tear':151 'tire':252 'togeth':140 'true':153 'understand':92 'undon':304 'undress':279 'untangl':40 'use':199 'valv':117 'wait':282 'want':179 'wear':256 'weigh':263 'whisper':189 'whole':42 'won':306 'work':131 'worri':201 'would':112,219 'wound':243
787	A.M. Fog	306		\nNight’s afterbirth, last dream before waking,  Holding on with dissolving hands, Out of it came, not a line of old men, But pairs of headlights, delaying morning. It felt like tears, like wetted bedsheets,  And suspended in it like a medicine In vapor was the ocean’s presence, ghost  Of deep water and the bite of salt. Here you found your body again, The hand before your face and the face it touched,  Eyes floating, feet on invisible ground, Vagueness like another skin. Sent out into it anyway, because it was morning,  To taste it, touch blind hardness Like marble ruins, and skirt the edges, Razors in goosedown, hydrants’ fists. Abruptly out of it waves appeared,  Transmuted from hanging silver ore, crafted  Before the eyes into curving metals That broke into soup scum, Queen Anne’s lace. Out of a great nothing, a theology. Out of the amorphous, an edgeless body  Or one like a hunting mass of tendrils That hurried down the sand, moved by hunger. I remember a gang of friends Racing a fog bank’s onslaught along the beach.  Seal-slick, warm from the sun This thing would eat, they ran laughing. The fog came on. And they were beautiful, The three boys and one girl, still in her wetsuit,  And the dissolution overtaking them, Their stridency, full of faith, still audible. All morning bathed in a dovelike brooding.  The fog satisfied itself by overwhelming The meagre dew, watering the doors  0f snails, the leeward mold, and held still. And then near noon there was a concentration As if the sky tried to find a slippery word  Or remember—that’s right—remember Where it was in an unfamiliar bedroom. And knew. And switched the light on. Wide awake. \n	'0f':249 'a.m':1 'abrupt':114 'afterbirth':5 'along':183 'amorph':151 'ann':138 'anoth':85 'anyway':91 'appear':119 'audibl':229 'awak':296 'bank':180 'bath':232 'beach':185 'beauti':207 'bedroom':287 'bedsheet':37 'bite':58 'blind':100 'bodi':65,154 'boy':210 'broke':133 'brood':236 'came':18,202 'concentr':264 'craft':125 'curv':130 'deep':54 'delay':29 'dew':245 'dissolut':220 'dissolv':13 'door':248 'dovelik':235 'dream':7 'eat':196 'edg':108 'edgeless':153 'eye':77,128 'face':71,74 'faith':227 'feet':79 'felt':32 'find':271 'fist':113 'float':78 'fog':2,179,201,238 'found':63 'friend':176 'full':225 'gang':174 'ghost':52 'girl':213 'goosedown':111 'great':144 'ground':82 'hand':14,68 'hang':122 'hard':101 'headlight':28 'held':255 'hold':10 'hunger':170 'hunt':159 'hurri':164 'hydrant':112 'invis':81 'knew':289 'lace':140 'last':6 'laugh':199 'leeward':252 'light':293 'like':33,35,42,84,102,157 'line':21 'marbl':103 'mass':160 'meagr':244 'medicin':44 'men':24 'metal':131 'mold':253 'morn':30,95,231 'move':168 'near':259 'night':3 'noon':260 'noth':145 'ocean':49 'old':23 'one':156,212 'onslaught':182 'ore':124 'overtak':221 'overwhelm':242 'pair':26 'presenc':51 'queen':137 'race':177 'ran':198 'razor':109 'rememb':172,276,280 'right':279 'ruin':104 'salt':60 'sand':167 'satisfi':239 'scum':136 'seal':187 'seal-slick':186 'sent':87 'silver':123 'skin':86 'skirt':106 'sky':268 'slick':188 'slipperi':273 'snail':250 'soup':135 'still':214,228,256 'stridenc':224 'sun':192 'suspend':39 'switch':291 'tast':97 'tear':34 'tendril':162 'theolog':147 'thing':194 'three':209 'touch':76,99 'transmut':120 'tri':269 'unfamiliar':286 'vagu':83 'vapor':46 'wake':9 'warm':189 'water':55,246 'wave':118 'wet':36 'wetsuit':217 'wide':295 'word':274 'would':195

Not Dante’s rings, not the Zen zero’s mouth,   Out of which comes and into which light goes,   This God recedes from every metaphor,   Turns the hardest data into untruth, And fills all blanks with blankness.

Because I’m older and I think God stirs In details that keep bringing back that time,  Details that are just as vivid now— Our bodies, bread, a sharp Umbrian wine. \n	'13':3 'american':33 'ancient':70 'anoth':36 'ask':79 'back':95 'besid':19 'bodi':50,106 'bread':51,107 'breed':66 'bring':94 'burn':69 'cloud':16 'dark':65 'detail':91,98 'drunk':4,12,22,30 'dusk':10 'enorm':67 'far':37 'forev':43 'glass':53 'god':46,74,88 'godless':63 'green':57 'hill':8 'home':39 'keep':93 'local':58 'm':83 'marbl':27 'moon':21,25 'need':45,73 'older':84 'one':14,35 'perfect':64 'pink':15 'raw':56 'sharp':109 'smile':28 'soft':68 'sonnet':2 'star':71 'stir':89 'stood':18 'think':87 'time':97 'two':31 'umbrian':7,110 'unholi':1 'vivid':103 'want':41 'watch':61 'wine':59,111 'young':32
791	Skin Cancer	306		\nBalmy overcast nights of late September; Palms standing out in street light, house light;  Full moon penetrating the cloud-film With an explosive halo, a ring almost half the sky;  Air like a towel draped over shoulders; Lightness or gravity deferred like a moral question;  The incense in the house lit; the young people Moving from the front door into the half-dark And back, or up the stairs to glimpse the lovers’ shoes  Outside the master bedroom; the youngest speculating;  The taste of beer, familiar as salt water; Each window holding a sea view, charcoal With shifting bars of white; the fog filling in Like the haze of distance itself, pushing close, blurring. As if the passage into life were through such houses,  Surrounded by some version of ocean weather, Lit beads of fog or wind so stripped it burns the throat;  Mildew-spreading, spray-laden breezes and the beach sun  Making each grain of stucco cast a shadow; An ideal landscape sheared of its nostalgia; S. with his black hair, buck teeth, unsunned skin,  Joking and disappearing; F. doing exactly the same  But dying, a corkscrew motion through green water;  And C. not looking back from the car door, Reappearing beside the East River, rich, owned, smiling at last. Swains. and nymphs. And news that came with the sea damp,  Of steady pipe-corrosions, black corners, Moisture working through sand lots, through slab floors,  Slowly, with chemical, with molecular intricacy, Then, bursting alive: the shrieked confessions Of the wild parents; the cliff collapse; the kidnap; The cache of photos; the letter; the weapon; the haunted dream; The sudden close-up of the loved one’s degradation. Weather a part of it all, permeating and sanctifying,  Infiltrating and destroying; the sun disc,  Cool behind the veil of afternoon cloud,  With sun spots like flies crawling across it;  The slow empurpling of skin all summer;  The glorious learned flesh and the rich pallor  Of the untouched places in the first nakedness;  The working of the lesion now in late life,  Soon to be known by the body, even the one  Enduring the bareness of the inland plains,  The cold fronts out of Canada, a sickness  For home that feels no different from health. \n	'across':315 'afternoon':307 'air':34 'aliv':252 'almost':30 'back':69,203 'balmi':3 'bar':103 'bare':361 'beach':157 'bead':137 'bedroom':82 'beer':89 'behind':303 'besid':209 'black':177,234 'blur':118 'bodi':355 'breez':154 'buck':179 'burn':145 'burst':251 'c':200 'cach':266 'came':224 'canada':371 'cancer':2 'car':206 'cast':164 'charcoal':100 'chemic':246 'cliff':261 'close':117,279 'close-up':278 'cloud':22,308 'cloud-film':21 'cold':367 'collaps':262 'confess':255 'cool':302 'corkscrew':194 'corner':235 'corros':233 'crawl':314 'damp':228 'dark':67 'defer':44 'degrad':286 'destroy':298 'die':192 'differ':379 'disappear':185 'disc':301 'distanc':114 'door':62,207 'drape':38 'dream':275 'east':211 'empurpl':319 'endur':359 'even':356 'exact':188 'explos':26 'f':186 'familiar':90 'feel':377 'fill':108 'film':23 'first':338 'flesh':327 'fli':313 'floor':243 'fog':107,139 'front':61,368 'full':17 'glimps':75 'glorious':325 'grain':161 'graviti':43 'green':197 'hair':178 'half':31,66 'half-dark':65 'halo':27 'haunt':274 'haze':112 'health':381 'hold':96 'home':375 'hous':15,53,128 'ideal':168 'incens':50 'infiltr':296 'inland':364 'intricaci':249 'joke':183 'kidnap':264 'known':352 'laden':153 'landscap':169 'last':217 'late':7,347 'learn':326 'lesion':344 'letter':270 'life':124,348 'light':14,16,41 'like':35,45,110,312 'lit':54,136 'look':202 'lot':240 'love':283 'lover':77 'make':159 'master':81 'mildew':149 'mildew-spread':148 'moistur':236 'molecular':248 'moon':18 'moral':47 'motion':195 'move':58 'naked':339 'news':222 'night':5 'nostalgia':173 'nymph':220 'ocean':134 'one':284,358 'outsid':79 'overcast':4 'own':214 'pallor':331 'palm':9 'parent':259 'part':289 'passag':122 'penetr':19 'peopl':57 'permeat':293 'photo':268 'pipe':232 'pipe-corros':231 'place':335 'plain':365 'push':116 'question':48 'reappear':208 'rich':213,330 'ring':29 'river':212 'salt':92 'sanctifi':295 'sand':239 'sea':98,227 'septemb':8 'shadow':166 'shear':170 'shift':102 'shoe':78 'shoulder':40 'shriek':254 'sick':373 'skin':1,182,321 'sky':33 'slab':242 'slow':318 'slowli':244 'smile':215 'soon':349 'specul':85 'spot':311 'spray':152 'spray-laden':151 'spread':150 'stair':73 'stand':10 'steadi':230 'street':13 'strip':143 'stucco':163 'sudden':277 'summer':323 'sun':158,300,310 'surround':129 'swain':218 'tast':87 'teeth':180 'throat':147 'towel':37 'unsun':181 'untouch':334 'veil':305 'version':132 'view':99 'water':93,198 'weapon':272 'weather':135,287 'white':105 'wild':258 'wind':141 'window':95 'work':237,341 'young':56 'youngest':84
792	Old Joke	307		\nRadiant child of Leto, farworking Lord Apollo, with lyre in hand and golden plectrum, you sang to the gods   on Mount Olympus almost as soon as you were born. You sang, and the Muses sang in answer, and together   your voices so delighted all your deathless elders that their perfect happiness was made more perfect still. What was it, though, that overwhelmed them, that suffused,   astonished, even the endless ether? Was it the freshest,   most wonderful stops of breath, the flawless intervals and scales whose harmonies were mimicking in sound   the beauty of the gods themselves, or what you joined   to that, what you were singing of, our balked desires, the miseries we suffer at your indifferent hands,   devastation and bereavement, old age and death?   Farworking, radiant child, what do you know about us? Here is my father, half blind, and palsied, at the toilet,   he’s shouting at his penis, Piss, you! Piss! Piss! but the penis (like the heavenly host to mortal prayers) is deaf and dumb; here, too, my mother with her bad knee,   on the eve of surgery, hobbling by the bathroom,   pausing, saying, who are you talking to in there? and he replies, no one you would know, sweetheart.   Supernal one, in your untested mastery,   your easy excellence, with nothing to overcome, and needing nothing but the most calamitous   and abject stories to prove how powerful you are,   how truly free, watch them as they laugh so briefly, godlike, better than gods, if only for a moment in which what goes wrong is converted to a rightness,   if only because now she’s hobbling back to bed where she won’t sleep, if only because he pees at last,   missing the bowl, and has to get down on his knees   to wipe it up. You don’t know anything about us.\n	'abject':228 'age':125 'almost':25 'answer':39 'anyth':306 'apollo':9 'astonish':68 'back':272 'bad':178 'balk':111 'bathroom':188 'beauti':94 'bed':274 'bereav':123 'better':247 'blind':142 'born':31 'bowl':289 'breath':81 'briefli':245 'calamit':226 'child':4,130 'convert':261 'deaf':169 'death':127 'deathless':48 'delight':45 'desir':112 'devast':121 'dumb':171 'easi':214 'elder':49 'endless':71 'ether':72 'eve':182 'even':69 'excel':215 'farwork':7,128 'father':140 'flawless':83 'free':238 'freshest':76 'get':293 'god':21,97,249 'godlik':246 'goe':258 'golden':15 'half':141 'hand':13,120 'happi':53 'harmoni':88 'heaven':163 'hobbl':185,271 'host':164 'indiffer':119 'interv':84 'join':102 'joke':2 'knee':179,297 'know':134,205,305 'last':286 'laugh':243 'leto':6 'like':161 'lord':8 'lyre':11 'made':55 'masteri':212 'mimick':90 'miseri':114 'miss':287 'moment':254 'mortal':166 'mother':175 'mount':23 'muse':36 'need':221 'noth':217,222 'old':1,124 'olympus':24 'one':202,208 'overcom':219 'overwhelm':64 'palsi':144 'paus':189 'pee':284 'peni':153,160 'perfect':52,57 'piss':154,156,157 'plectrum':16 'power':233 'prayer':167 'prove':231 'radiant':3,129 'repli':200 'right':264 'sang':18,33,37 'say':190 'scale':86 'shout':150 'sing':108 'sleep':279 'soon':27 'sound':92 'still':58 'stop':79 'stori':229 'suffer':116 'suffus':67 'supern':207 'surgeri':184 'sweetheart':206 'talk':194 'though':62 'togeth':41 'toilet':147 'truli':237 'untest':211 'us':136,308 'voic':43 'watch':239 'whose':87 'wipe':299 'won':277 'wonder':78 'would':204 'wrong':259

801	The Pope Replies to the Ayatollah Khomeini	308		\nMy Dear Khomeini: I read your fourteen thousand dollar ad asking me why the Vatican waited all of these years to send an envoy to complain about conditions in Iran You’re right, we should have sent one when the Shah was in power, look, I’m in total agreement with you Khomeini, that Christ, had he lived in Iran under the Shah, would have led the biggest damned revolt you ever saw Believe me, Khomeini, I knew about the Shah’s decadence, his extravagance his misdeeds, and how he lolled about in luxury with Iran’s loot I knew about the trail of jewels which led to his Dad’s capture but a fella has to eat and so when David Rockefeller asked me to do something how could I refuse?

Death,  Meanwhile, in a strange  Part of town looking for  Someone with a bad cough, But the address is somehow wrong,  Even death can’t figure it out  Among all the locked doors ...    And the rain beginning to fall.

808	Prodigy	259		\nI grew up bent over   a chessboard. I loved the word endgame. All my cousins looked worried. It was a small house near a Roman graveyard.   Planes and tanks shook its windowpanes. A retired professor of astronomy   taught me how to play. That must have been in 1944. In the set we were using, the paint had almost chipped off   the black pieces. The white King was missing   and had to be substituted for. I’m told but do not believe   that that summer I witnessed   men hung from telephone poles. I remember my mother   blindfolding me a lot. She had a way of tucking my head   suddenly under her overcoat. In chess, too, the professor told me,   the masters play blindfolded,   the great ones on several boards   at the same time.\n	'1944':49 'almost':59 'astronomi':38 'believ':82 'bent':5 'black':63 'blindfold':97,123 'board':129 'chess':114 'chessboard':8 'chip':60 'cousin':16 'endgam':13 'graveyard':27 'great':125 'grew':3 'head':108 'hous':23 'hung':89 'king':67 'look':17 'lot':100 'love':10 'm':77 'master':121 'men':88 'miss':69 'mother':96 'must':45 'near':24 'one':126 'overcoat':112 'paint':57 'piec':64 'plane':28 'play':43,122 'pole':92 'prodigi':1 'professor':36,117 'rememb':94 'retir':35 'roman':26 'set':52 'sever':128 'shook':31 'small':22 'substitut':74 'sudden':109 'summer':85 'tank':30 'taught':39 'telephon':91 'time':133 'told':78,118 'tuck':106 'use':55 'way':104 'white':66 'windowpan':33 'wit':87 'word':12 'worri':18
809	Concerning My Neighbors, the Hittites	259		\nGreat are the Hittites. Their ears have mice and mice have holes. Their dogs bury themselves and leave the bones To guard the house. A single weed holds all their storms  Until the spiderwebs spread over the heavens. There are bits of straw in their lakes and rivers  Looking for drowned men. When a camel won’t pass  Through the eye of one of their needles, They tie a house to its tail. Great are the Hittites.  Their fathers are in cradles, their newborn make war.  To them lead floats, a leaf sinks. Their god is the size  Of a mustard seed so that he can be quickly eaten. They also piss against the wind,  Pour water in a leaky bucket. Strike two tears to make fire, And have tongues with bones in them, Bones of a wolf gnawed by lambs.     * They are also called mound builders,  They are called Asiatic horses That will drink on the Rhine, they are called My grandmother’s fortune-telling, they are called  You can’t take it to the grave with you. It’s that hum in your left ear, A sigh coming from deep within you, A dream in which you keep falling forever,  The hour in which you sit up in bed As though someone has shouted your name. No one knows why the Hittites exist,  Still, when two are whispering  One of them is listening. Did they catch the falling knife? They caught it like a fly with closed mouths.  Did they balance the last egg? They struck the egg with a bone so it won’t howl.  Did they wait for dead man’s shoes? The shoes went in at one ear and out the other.  Did they wipe the blood from their mousetraps?  They burnt the blood to warm themselves.  Are they cold with no pockets in their shrouds?  If the sky falls, they shall have clouds for supper. What do they have for us To put in our pipes and smoke? They have the braid of a beautiful girl  That drew a team of cattle And the engraving of him who slept  With dogs and rose with fleas  Searching for its trace in the sky.     * And so there are fewer and fewer of them now.  Who wrote their name on paper And burnt the paper? Who put snake bones  In their pillows? Who threw nail parings  In their soup? Who made them walk Under the ladder? Who stuck pins In their snapshots? The wart of warts and his brother evil eye.  Bone-lazy and her sister rabbit’s-foot.  Cross-your-fingers and their father dog star.  Knock-on-wood and his mother hellfire. Because the tail can’t wag the cow. Because the woods can’t fly to the dove.  Because the stones haven’t said their last word.  Because dunghills rise and empires fall.     * They are leaving behind All the silver spoons Found inside their throats at birth,  A hand they bit because it fed them, Two rats from a ship that is still sinking,  A collection of various split hairs,  The leaf they turned over too late.     * All that salt cast over the shoulder, All that bloody meat traveling under the saddles of nomads ...  Here comes a forest in wolf’s clothing,  The wise hen bows to the umbrella. When the bloodshot evening meets the bloodshot night,  They tell each other bloodshot tales. That bare branch over them speaks louder than words.  The moon is worn threadbare. I repeat: lean days don’t come singly,  It takes all kinds to make the sun rise. The night is each man’s castle.  Don’t let the castle out of the bag. Wind in the valley, wind in the high hills,  Practice will make this body fit this bed.     * May all roads lead  Out of a sow’s ear  To what’s worth  Two in the bush.\n	'also':116,149 'asiat':156 'bag':626 'balanc':259 'bare':581 'beauti':347 'bed':217,643 'behind':493 'birth':503 'bit':46,507 'blood':298,305 'bloodi':543 'bloodshot':568,572,578 'bodi':640 'bone':25,137,140,269,398,432 'bone-lazi':431 'bow':562 'braid':344 'branch':582 'brother':428 'bucket':126 'builder':152 'buri':20 'burnt':303,392 'bush':661 'call':150,155,166,175 'camel':60 'cast':537 'castl':617,622 'catch':244 'cattl':354 'caught':249 'close':255 'cloth':558 'cloud':325 'cold':311 'collect':522 'come':196,552,600 'concern':1 'cow':465 'cradl':87 'cross':442 'cross-your-fing':441 'day':597 'dead':279 'deep':198 'dog':19,363,448 'dove':474 'dream':202 'drew':350 'drink':160 'drown':56 'dunghil':485 'ear':11,193,289,653 'eaten':114 'egg':262,266 'empir':488 'engrav':357 'even':569 'evil':429 'exist':231 'eye':66,430 'fall':207,246,321,489 'father':84,447 'fed':510 'fewer':379,381 'finger':444 'fire':132 'fit':641 'flea':367 'fli':253,471 'float':95 'foot':440 'forest':554 'forev':208 'fortun':171 'fortune-tel':170 'found':498 'girl':348 'gnaw':144 'god':100 'grandmoth':168 'grave':183 'great':6,79 'guard':27 'hair':526 'hand':505 'haven':478 'heaven':43 'hellfir':457 'hen':561 'high':634 'hill':635 'hittit':5,9,82,230 'hold':33 'hole':17 'hors':157 'hour':210 'hous':29,75 'howl':274 'hum':189 'insid':499 'keep':206 'kind':605 'knife':247 'knock':451 'knock-on-wood':450 'know':227 'ladder':415 'lake':51 'lamb':146 'last':261,482 'late':533 'lazi':433 'lead':94,647 'leaf':97,528 'leaki':125 'lean':596 'leav':23,492 'left':192 'let':620 'like':251 'listen':241 'look':54 'louder':586 'made':410 'make':90,131,607,638 'man':280,615 'may':644 'meat':544 'meet':570 'men':57 'mice':13,15 'moon':590 'mother':456 'mound':151 'mousetrap':301 'mouth':256 'mustard':106 'nail':404 'name':224,388 'needl':71 'neighbor':3 'newborn':89 'night':573,612 'nomad':550 'one':68,226,237,288 'paper':390,394 'pare':405 'pass':63 'pillow':401 'pin':418 'pipe':338 'piss':117 'pocket':314 'pour':121 'practic':636 'put':335,396 'quick':113 'rabbit':437 'rat':513 'repeat':595 'rhine':163 'rise':486,610 'river':53 'road':646 'rose':365 's-foot':438 'saddl':548 'said':480 'salt':536 'search':368 'seed':107 'shall':323 'ship':516 'shoe':282,284 'shoulder':540 'shout':222 'shroud':317 'sigh':195 'silver':496 'singl':31,601 'sink':98,520 'sister':436 'sit':214 'size':103 'sky':320,374 'slept':361 'smoke':340 'snake':397 'snapshot':421 'someon':220 'soup':408 'sow':651 'speak':585 'spiderweb':39 'split':525 'spoon':497 'spread':40 'star':449 'still':232,519 'stone':477 'storm':36 'straw':48 'strike':127 'struck':264 'stuck':417 'sun':609 'supper':327 'tail':78,460 'take':179,603 'tale':579 'team':352 'tear':129 'tell':172,575 'though':219 'threadbar':593 'threw':403 'throat':501 'tie':73 'tongu':135 'trace':371 'travel':545 'turn':530 'two':128,234,512,658 'umbrella':565 'us':333 'valley':630 'various':524 'wag':463 'wait':277 'walk':412 'war':91 'warm':307 'wart':423,425 'water':122 'weed':32 'went':285 'whisper':236 'wind':120,627,631 'wipe':296 'wise':560 'within':199 'wolf':143,556 'won':61,272 'wood':453,468 'word':483,588 'worn':592 'worth':657 'wrote':386
810	Gyroscope	309		\nThis admirable gadget, when it is Wound on a string and spun with steady force,  Maintains its balance on most any smooth Surface, pleasantly humming as it goes. It is whirled not on a constant course, but still  Stands in unshivering integrity For quite some time, meaning nothing perhaps  But being something agreeable to watch,  A silver nearly silence gleaning a still- ness out of speed, composing unity  From spin, so that its hollow spaces seem  Solids of light, until it wobbles and  Begins to whine, and then with an odd lunge  Eccentric and reckless, it skids away  And drops dead into its own skeleton.\n	'admir':3 'agreeabl':54 'away':99 'balanc':19 'begin':85 'compos':68 'constant':36 'cours':37 'dead':102 'drop':101 'eccentr':94 'forc':16 'gadget':4 'glean':61 'goe':29 'gyroscop':1 'hollow':75 'hum':26 'integr':43 'light':80 'lung':93 'maintain':17 'mean':48 'near':59 'ness':64 'noth':49 'odd':92 'perhap':50 'pleasant':25 'quit':45 'reckless':96 'seem':77 'silenc':60 'silver':58 'skeleton':106 'skid':98 'smooth':23 'solid':78 'someth':53 'space':76 'speed':67 'spin':71 'spun':13 'stand':40 'steadi':15 'still':39,63 'string':11 'surfac':24 'time':47 'uniti':69 'unshiv':42 'watch':56 'whine':87 'whirl':32 'wobbl':83 'wound':8
811	Covenant	307		\nThe oldest sister, her two hands on the table,  about to push herself up, stares with grim  determination at the affronting dishes,  waiting, it seems, until the middle sister  finishes her story, so she can clear them away.  Her gaze so tense with purpose she can almost  see germs spawning in the mess of white fish  flaking from the spines, the smear of egg yolk  and the torn rolls disfiguring the china;  as if the meal, the moment it is over, the meal she made a point of telling them  she shopped for, got up early to prepare,  were now inedible, because uneaten. It’s no great comfort either that her brother  sitting opposite holds up a flared match  over the pipe from which smoke rolls away  across the table like a phantom mold in and around the open tub of butter, the gouged block of cream cheese and the coffee cups;  so in a moment when she finally does stand she’ll say again, as always, For love or money  in my mouth I’d never put such filth,  and he’ll say, winking at the middle sister,  That’s what she said on her honeymoon. The youngest sister is sitting on the couch behind the table; her face—sheer disengagement,  toneless and still—appears to hang suspended  beyond the oldest sister’s shoulder, far  enough away for no one yet to notice  as her legs cross that the ashtray in her lap  spills ash over the sunflowers of her housedress.  Or that the cigarette between her fingers  sags loosely and is dangling while the hand  lifts like a puppet’s on a string of smoke. Her death is just three months away. Even though it’s summer (otherwise the brother and middle sister would be home,  in Florida), summer and late morning— with sunlight only just now catching on a corner of the window shut behind them, shut against the smog, the steady traffic and the panicked blare and drawn-out whining fade  of sirens—the apartment is still quiet, still cool enough, right now, to keep the body  in the wavering frail zone of what it needs to be forgotten, so they can sit like this together, with the oldest sister’s sharp eye on the wrecked meal, the brother and sister talking: Listen, she would be saying, listen, Charlie,  her elbows on the table, both hands open,  the body fashioned to the voice’s weary  What can you do? What are ya gonna do?  in answer to some story of a cousin’s  sudden illness (And he was my age, just like that one day he’s shaving with the toothpaste), or a friend’s death (That one, she didn’t care  how sick she got, she always had her hair done),  his back pain, her arthritis, or the daughter  who won’t diet (And she’d be such a beauty!);  after his joke about the nurse, and hers  about the bedpan, Listen, they each say,  Listen, what are ya gonna do?                                               “The Schmo, he never should’ve married her, for Christ sake,  until he told her that he had a problem,  that was his first mistake, then he goes  throwing away his pills, because he’s happy  he doesn’t need them anymore, the schmo,  so of course what happens is she wakes up  and finds him weeping at the kitchen table, just weeping, he doesn’t know why, he won’t eat,  won’t get dressed, says he’s quittin’ his job, you know, nuts, nuts, so naturally she leaves him,  the poor schmo, and he’s such a good boy . . . ” All of the harm that’s imperceptibly but surely coming for them (the way the sun burns brick by brick all morning toward the window  like a slow fuse)—all of the bad news now is in the body only enough to hold the middle sister’s two hands open, shrug her shoulders in a way they recognize  as hers, the way their mother did; as if  all trouble were, for now, no heavier  than the familiar voice repeating, Listen,  Listen it could be worse; So who’s to say?; What was, was; When your number’s up—like old charms  woven around each story till they’ve made  what happens what was only meant to happen,  coherent with fate, fated as family. After the funeral three months from now,  they’ll have to listen to the oldest sister tell them they had no business moving away  to Florida, and Irene sick as she was.  And selfish. She was selfish, that one. After  all those years of living with that bum, her husband, may his cheap soul rest in peace,  didn’t she deserve a little pleasure? And anyway, what could be done for her?  Didn’t the stroke just make it easier for her to sit all day, and smoke, and not care  ashes were falling on the couch, the carpet; her bathrobe filthy, filthy? Oh it was terrible— and now they will hear the old unfairnesses,  old feuds and resentments come to her voice  like consolation, like a mother helping  her recite the story of that last bad day— all that smoke, and running in with nothing  but the dishtowel to beat down the flames,  and Irene, just Irene, just sitting there, the queen of Sheba—What difference did it make  since she was there, she was always there,  her big sister, to clean up the mess? Only three months, and yet it could be years,  or decades, for the sun has only just now caught in the window, and its bright plaque warms  the air so gradually that none of them can know it’s warming, or that soon someone,  distracted by a faint sheen prickling the skin,  will break the story, look up toward the window  and, startled by the full glare, check the time.  Right now, though, the future is a luxury  of instances in which the cigarette, raised halfway to the lips, will go on rising.  Nothing bad, right now, can happen here  except as news, bad news the brother and sister  mull and rehearse, puzzle and fret until  it seems the very telling of it is what keeps them safe. And safe, too, the oldest sister,  dreaming of all the perishables sealed,  wrapped up and hurried back into the fridge’s  uncontaminated airlessness, dreaming of how the soapsuds curdle and slide  over the dishes in a soothing fury, not minding that it scalds her hands to hold  each plate and cup and bowl under the hot,  hard jet of water, if it gets them clean.\n	'across':129 'affront':22

813	Scree	307		\nLong scree of pill bottles          spilling over the tipped brim  of the wicker basket, fifty or more,           a hundred, your name on every one and under          your name the brusque rune of instructions— which ones to take, how many, and often,          on what days, with or without food, before or          after eating, impossible toward the end to keep them all straight,           not even with your charts, your calendars, the bottles           ranged in sequence along the kitchen  counter—you always so          efficient, organized, never without a plan,          even when planning had come down  to this and nothing more, for there was           still a future in it, though the future reached          only from one bottle to the next, from pill to pill, each one          another toehold giving way          beneath you on the steep slope  you never stopped struggling against,           unable not to climb, and then, when climbing          was impossible, not to try slowing  the quickening descent. You had          descended now, your body thinned to the machine          of holding on, while I exhausted  by the vigil, with all your medicine          spread before me, looked for something, anything          at all to help me sleep.  To help me for a short while anyway          not be aware of you, your gaunt hand          clutching the guardrail, your eyes  blind, flitting, scanning, it seemed,           the air above them for their own sight, and the whimper           far back in the throat, the barely  audible continuous          half-cry half- wheeze I couldn’t hear and not think          you were saying something, though  I couldn’t make out what. I wanted          to sleep, I wanted if just for that one night          to meet you there on that steep slope,  the two of us together, facing          opposite directions, I, because I wasn’t          dying, looking down, desiring  what you, still looking up, resisted,           because you were.\n	'air':219 'along':75 'alway':80 'anoth':124 'anyth':185 'anyway':199 'audibl':236 'awar':202 'back':230 'bare':235 'basket':15 'beneath':128 'blind':213 'bodi':161 'bottl':6,71,114 'brim':11 'brusqu':31 'calendar':69 'chart':67 'climb':142,146 'clutch':208 'come':92 'continu':237 'couldn':244,256 'counter':78 'cri':240 'day':45 'descend':158 'descent':155 'desir':297 'die':294 'direct':288 'eat':53 'effici':82 'end':57 'even':64,88 'everi':24 'exhaust':171 'eye':212 'face':286 'far':229 'fifti':16 'flit':214 'food':49 'futur':104,109 'gaunt':206 'give':126 'guardrail':210 'half':239,241 'half-cri':238 'hand':207 'hear':246 'help':189,193 'hold':167 'hundr':20 'imposs':54,148 'instruct':34 'keep':59 'kitchen':77 'long':2 'look':182,295,301 'machin':165 'make':258 'mani':40 'medicin':178 'meet':274 'name':22,29 'never':84,135 'next':117 'night':272 'noth':97 'often':42 'one':25,36,113,123,271 'opposit':287 'organ':83 'pill':5,119,121 'plan':87,90 'quicken':154 'rang':72 'reach':110 'resist':303 'rune':32 'say':252 'scan':215 'scree':1,3 'seem':217 'sequenc':74 'short':197 'sight':225 'sleep':191,264 'slope':133,280 'slow':152 'someth':184,253 'spill':7 'spread':179 'steep':132,279 'still':102,300 'stop':136 'straight':62 'struggl':137 'take':38 'thin':162 'think':249 'though':107,254 'throat':233 'tip':10 'toehold':125 'togeth':285 'toward':55 'tri':151 'two':282 'unabl':139 'us':284 'vigil':174 'want':262,266 'wasn':292 'way':127 'wheez':242 'whimper':228 'wicker':14 'without':48,85

815	Joy	307		\nWhat never comes when called.                                              What hides when held.

816	The Heaven of Animals	311		\nHere they are. The soft eyes open.   If they have lived in a wood It is a wood. If they have lived on plains It is grass rolling Under their feet forever. Having no souls, they have come,   Anyway, beyond their knowing.   Their instincts wholly bloom   And they rise. The soft eyes open. To match them, the landscape flowers,   Outdoing, desperately Outdoing what is required: The richest wood, The deepest field. For some of these, It could not be the place It is, without blood. These hunt, as they have done, But with claws and teeth grown perfect, More deadly than they can believe.   They stalk more silently, And crouch on the limbs of trees,   And their descent Upon the bright backs of their prey May take years In a sovereign floating of joy.   And those that are hunted   Know this as their life, Their reward: to walk Under such trees in full knowledge   Of what is in glory above them,   And to feel no fear, But acceptance, compliance.   Fulfilling themselves without pain At the cycle’s center, They tremble, they walk   Under the tree, They fall, they are torn,   They rise, they walk again.\n	'accept':172 'anim':4 'anyway':43 'back':126 'believ':108 'beyond':44 'blood':89 'bloom':50 'bright':125 'center':182 'claw':98 'come':42 'complianc':173 'could':81 'crouch':114 'cycl':180 'dead':104 'deepest':74 'descent':122 'desper':65 'done':95 'eye':10,56 'fall':191 'fear':170 'feel':168 'feet':35 'field':75 'float':136 'flower':63 'forev':36 'fulfil':174 'full':157 'glori':163 'grass':31 'grown':101 'heaven':2 'hunt':91,143 'instinct':48 'joy':138 'know':46,144 'knowledg':158 'landscap':62 'life':148 'limb':117 'live':15,26 'match':59 'may':130 'open':11,57 'outdo':64,66 'pain':177 'perfect':102 'place':85 'plain':28 'prey':129 'requir':69 'reward':150 'richest':71 'rise':53,196 'roll':32 'silent':112 'soft':9,55 'soul':39 'sovereign':135 'stalk':110 'take':131 'teeth':100 'torn':194 'tree':119,155,189 'trembl':184 'upon':123 'walk':152,186,198 'wholli':49 'without':88,176 'wood':18,22,72 'year':132
817	Cherrylog Road	311		\nOff Highway 106 At Cherrylog Road I entered   The ’34 Ford without wheels,   Smothered in kudzu, With a seat pulled out to run Corn whiskey down from the hills, And then from the other side   Crept into an Essex With a rumble seat of red leather   And then out again, aboard   A blue Chevrolet, releasing   The rust from its other color, Reared up on three building blocks.   None had the same body heat; I changed with them inward, toward   The weedy heart of the junkyard,   For I knew that Doris Holbrook   Would escape from her father at noon And would come from the farm   To seek parts owned by the sun   Among the abandoned chassis,   Sitting in each in turn As I did, leaning forward As in a wild stock-car race In the parking lot of the dead.   Time after time, I climbed in   And out the other side, like   An envoy or movie star Met at the station by crickets.   A radiator cap raised its head, Become a real toad or a kingsnake   As I neared the hub of the yard,   Passing through many states,   Many lives, to reach Some grandmother’s long Pierce-Arrow   Sending platters of blindness forth From its nickel hubcaps And spilling its tender upholstery On sleepy roaches, The glass panel in between   Lady and colored driver   Not all the way broken out, The back-seat phone Still on its hook. I got in as though to exclaim,   “Let us go to the orphan asylum,   John; I have some old toys For children who say their prayers.” I popped with sweat as I thought   I heard Doris Holbrook scrape Like a mouse in the southern-state sun   That was eating the paint in blisters   From a hundred car tops and hoods.   She was tapping like code, Loosening the screws,   Carrying off headlights,   Sparkplugs, bumpers, Cracked mirrors and gear-knobs,   Getting ready, already, To go back with something to show Other than her lips’ new trembling   I would hold to me soon, soon,   Where I sat in the ripped back seat Talking over the interphone,   Praying for Doris Holbrook   To come from her father’s farm And to get back there With no trace of me on her face To be seen by her red-haired father Who would change, in the squalling barn,   Her back’s pale skin with a strop, Then lay for me In a bootlegger’s roasting car With a string-triggered I2-gauge shotgun   To blast the breath from the air. Not cut by the jagged windshields,   Through the acres of wrecks she came   With a wrench in her hand, Through dust where the blacksnake dies   Of boredom, and the beetle knows   The compost has no more life. Someone outside would have seen   The oldest car's door inexplicably   Close from within: I held her and held her and held her,   Convoyed at terrific speed By the stalled, dreaming traffic around us,   So the blacksnake, stiff With inaction, curved back Into life, and hunted the mouse With deadly overexcitement,   The beetles reclaimed their field   As we clung, glued together, With the hooks of the seat springs   Working through to catch us red-handed   Amidst the gray breathless batting That burst from the seat at our backs.   We left by separate doors Into the changed, other bodies Of cars, she down Cherrylog Road   And I to my motorcycle Parked like the soul of the junkyard Restored, a bicycle fleshed With power, and tore off Up Highway 106, continually   Drunk on the wind in my mouth,   Wringing the handlebar for speed,   Wild to be wreckage forever.\n	'106':5,597 '34':12 'abandon':116 'aboard':53 'acr':440 'air':431 'alreadi':325 'amidst':545 'among':114 'around':501 'arrow':201 'asylum':256 'back':236,328,352,372,399,510,557 'back-seat':235 'barn':397 'bat':549 'becom':172 'beetl':461,521 'bicycl':588 'blacksnak':455,505 'blast':426 'blind':205 'blister':296 'block':69 'blue':55 'bodi':74,567 'bootlegg':412 'boredom':458 'breath':428 'breathless':548 'broken':232 'build':68 'bumper':316 'burst':551 'came':444 'cap':168 'car':134,300,415,476,569 'carri':312 'catch':540 'chang':77,393,565 'chassi':117 'cherrylog':1,7,572 'chevrolet':56 'children':264 'climb':147 'close':480 'clung':527 'code':308 'color':63,226 'come':103,363 'compost':464 'continu':598 'convoy':492 'corn':26 'crack':317 'crept':38 'cricket':165 'curv':509 'cut':433 'dead':142,518 'die':456 'door':478,562 'dori':92,278,360 'dream':499 'driver':227 'drunk':599 'dust':452 'eat':292 'enter':10 'envoy':156 'escap':95 'essex':41 'exclaim':249 'face':381 'farm':106,368 'father':98,366,390 'field':524 'flesh':589 'ford':13 'forev':615 'forth':206 'forward':127 'gaug':423 'gear':321 'gear-knob':320 'get':323,371 'glass':220 'glu':528 'go':252,327 'got':244 'grandmoth':196 'gray':547 'hair':389 'hand':450,544 'handlebar':608 'head':171 'headlight':314 'heard':277 'heart':84 'heat':75 'held':484,487,490 'highway':4,596 'hill':31 'holbrook':93,279,361 'hold':341 'hood':303 'hook':242,532 'hub':183 'hubcap':210 'hundr':299 'hunt':514 'i2':422 'i2-gauge':421 'inact':508 'inexplic':479 'interphon':357 'inward':80 'jag':436 'john':257 'junkyard':87,585 'kingsnak':178 'knew':90 'knob':322 'know':462 'kudzu':18 'ladi':224 'lay':407 'lean':126 'leather':48 'left':559 'let':250 'life':468,512 'like':154,281,307,580 'lip':336 'live':192 'long':198 'loosen':309 'lot':139 'mani':189,191 'met':160 'mirror':318 'motorcycl':578 'mous':283,516 'mouth':605 'movi':158 'near':181 'new':337 'nickel':209 'none':70 'noon':100 'old':261 'oldest':475 'orphan':255 'outsid':470 'overexcit':519 'own':110 'paint':294 'pale':401 'panel':221 'park':138,579 'part':109 'pass':187 'phone':238 'pierc':200 'pierce-arrow':199 'platter':203 'pop':270 'power':591 'pray':358 'prayer':268 'pull':22 'race':135 'radiat':167 'rais':169 'reach':194 'readi':324 'real':174 'rear':64 'reclaim':522 'red':47,388,543 'red-hair':387 'red-hand':542 'releas':57 'restor':586 'rip':351 'roach':218 'road':2,8,573 'roast':414 'rumbl':44 'run':25 'rust':59 'sat':348 'say':266 'scrape':280 'screw':311 'seat':21,45,237,353,535,554 'seek':108 'seen':384,473 'send':202 'separ':561 'shotgun':424 'show':332 'side':37,153 'sit':118 'skin':402 'sleepi':217 'smother':16 'someon':469 'someth':330 'soon':344,345 'soul':582 'southern':287 'southern-st':286 'sparkplug':315 'speed':495,610 'spill':212 'spring':536 'squall':396 'stall':498 'star':159 'state':190,288 'station':163 'stiff':506 'still':239 'stock':133 'stock-car':132 'string':419 'string-trigg':418 'strop':405 'sun':113,289 'sweat':272 'talk':354 'tap':306 'tender':214 'terrif':494 'though':247 'thought':275 'three':67 'time':143,145 'toad':175 'togeth':529 'top':301 'tore':593 'toward':81 'toy':262 'trace':376 'traffic':500 'trembl':338 'trigger':420 'turn':122 'upholsteri':215 'us':251,502,541 'way':231 'weedi':83 'wheel':15 'whiskey':27 'wild':131,611 'wind':602 'windshield':437 'within':482 'without':14 'work':537 'would':94,102,340,392,471 'wreck':442 'wreckag':614 'wrench':447 'wring':606 'yard':186

818	The Sheep Child	311		\nFarm boys wild to couple With anything      with soft-wooded trees   With mounds of earth      mounds   Of pinestraw      will keep themselves off   Animals by legends of their own:   In the hay-tunnel dark And dung of barns, they will   Say    I have heard tell That in a museum in Atlanta   Way back in a corner somewhere   There’s this thing that’s only half   Sheep      like a woolly baby Pickled in alcohol      because   Those things can’t live.      his eyes Are open      but you can’t stand to look   I heard from somebody who ... But this is now almost all   Gone. The boys have taken   Their own true wives in the city, The sheep are safe in the west hill Pasture      but we who were born there Still are not sure. Are we, Because we remember, remembered In the terrible dust of museums? Merely with his eyes, the sheep-child may   Be saying      saying          I am here, in my father’s house.          I who am half of your world, came deeply          To my mother in the long grass          Of the west pasture, where she stood like moonlight          Listening for foxes. It was something like love          From another world that seized her          From behind, and she gave, not lifting her head            Out of dew, without ever looking, her best          Self to that great need. Turned loose, she dipped her face            Farther into the chill of the earth, and in a sound            Of sobbing      of something stumbling          Away, began, as she must do,          To carry me. I woke, dying,          In the summer sun of the hillside, with my eyes          Far more than human. I saw for a blazing moment            The great grassy world from both sides,          Man and beast in the round of their need,          And the hill wind stirred in my wool,          My hoof and my hand clasped each other,          I ate my one meal          Of milk, and died          Staring. From dark grass I came straight                    To my father’s house, whose dust          Whirls up in the halls for no reason          When no one comes      piling deep in a hellish mild corner,            And, through my immortal waters,          I meet the sun’s grains eye          To eye, and they fail at my closet of glass.          Dead, I am most surely living          In the minds of farm boys: I am he who drives          Them like wolves from the hound bitch and calf          And from the chaste ewe in the wind.          They go into woods      into bean fields      they go          Deep into their known right hands. Dreaming of me,            They groan      they wait      they suffer          Themselves, they marry, they raise their kind.

819	The Strength of Fields	311		\nMoth-force a small town always has,             Given the night.                                                 What field-forms can be,          Outlying the small civic light-decisions over                A man walking near home?                                                                          Men are not where he is         Exactly now, but they are around him    around him like the strength Of fields.    The solar system floats on     Above him in town-moths.                                                          Tell me, train-sound,     With all your long-lost grief,                                                          what I can give.       Dear Lord of all the fields                                                          what am I going to do?                                         Street-lights, blue-force and frail As the homes of men, tell me how to do it    how     To withdraw    how to penetrate and find the source         Of the power you always had                                                             light as a moth, and rising        With the level and moonlit expansion     Of the fields around, and the sleep of hoping men.        You?    I?    What difference is there?    We can all be saved        By a secret blooming.

Lord, let me shake            With purpose.    Wild hope can always spring            From tended strength.    Everything is in that.             That and nothing but kindness.    More kindness, dear Lord Of the renewing green.    That is where it all has to start:          With the simplest things. More kindness will do nothing less              Than save every sleeping one              And night-walking one          Of us.                          My life belongs to the world. I will do what I can.\n	'air':218 'alway':11,127,319 'around':46,48,144 'away':202,271 'bed':195 'belong':373 'better':263 'bloom':165 'blue':98,214 'blue-forc':97 'brain':298 'civic':25 'close':181 'conquer':210 'crave':282 'dead':226 'dear':82,335 'decis':28 'deep':194,275 'deep-structur':274 'differ':154 'els':246 'everi':361 'everyth':324 'exact':41 'excit':302 'expans':140 'field':4,18,54,87,143,309 'field-form':17 'find':120 'float':58 'forc':7,99 'form':19 'frail':101 'freight':239 'freight-train':238 'fumbl':273 'give':81 'given':13 'go':91 'green':340 'grief':77 'hear':248 'help':235 'home':34,104,193,216 'home-deep':192 'home-town':215 'hope':149,317 'hundr':268 'hunger':288 'kind':332,334,354 'know':178,197,204 'less':358 'let':311 'level':137 'lie':227,295 'life':372 'lift':267 'light':27,96,129 'light-decis':26 'like':50,278 'long':75 'long-lost':74 'look':232 'lord':83,310,336 'lost':76 'man':31 'men':35,106,150,187 'mile':270 'moon':292,294 'moonlit':139 'moth':6,65,132,212 'moth-forc':5 'nation':284 'near':33 'night':15,171,366 'night-walk':365 'noth':330,357 'one':245,264,363,368 'out':22 'pastur':230 'penetr':118 'point':222 'power':125 'profound':280 'purpos':315 'renew':339 'rise':134 'roar':277 'save':161,360 'sea':255,303 'search':188 'secret':164 'shake':313 'simplest':351 'simplic':179 'sleep':147,186,362 'small':9,24 'solar':56 'sound':70 'sourc':122,184 'splinter':221 'spring':320 'star':220 'start':348 'street':95 'street-light':94 'strength':2,52,307,323 'structur':276 'sun':200,207 'system':57 'tell':66,107,236,249 'tend':322 'thing':352 'time':289 'town':10,64,217 'town-moth':63 'train':69,240 'train-sound':68 'unstopp':281 'us':370 'voic':253 'walk':32,169,174,367 'wild':224,316 'wish':287 'withdraw':115 'world':376 'would':256

821	Falling	311		\nThe states when they black out and lie there rolling    when they turn To something transcontinental    move by    drawing moonlight out of the great One-sided stone hung off the starboard wingtip    some sleeper next to An engine is groaning for coffee    and there is faintly coming in Somewhere the vast beast-whistle of space. In the galley with its racks Of trays    she rummages for a blanket    and moves in her slim tailored Uniform to pin it over the cry at the top of the door. As though she blew The door down with a silent blast from her lungs    frozen    she is black Out finding herself    with the plane nowhere and her body taken by the throat The undying cry of the void    falling    living    beginning to be something That no one has ever been and lived through    screaming without enough air Still neat    lipsticked    stockinged    girdled by regulation    her hat Still on    her arms and legs in no world    and yet spaced also strangely With utter placid rightness on thin air    taking her time    she holds it In many places    and now, still thousands of feet from her death she seems To slow    she develops interest    she turns in her maneuverable body To watch it. She is hung high up in the overwhelming middle of things in her Self    in low body-whistling wrapped intensely    in all her dark dance-weight Coming down from a marvellous leap    with the delaying, dumfounding ease Of a dream of being drawn    like endless moonlight to the harvest soil Of a central state of one’s country    with a great gradual warmth coming Over her    floating    finding more and more breath in what she has been using For breath    as the levels become more human    seeing clouds placed honestly Below her left and right    riding slowly toward them    she clasps it all To her and can hang her hands and feet in it in peculiar ways    and Her eyes opened wide by wind, can open her mouth as wide    wider and suck All the heat from the cornfields    can go down on her back with a feeling Of stupendous pillows stacked under her    and can turn    turn as to someone In bed    smile, understood in darkness    can go away    slant    slide Off tumbling    into the emblem of a bird with its wings half-spread Or whirl madly on herself    in endless gymnastics in the growing warmth Of wheatfields rising toward the harvest moon.    There is time to live In superhuman health    seeing mortal unreachable lights far down seeing An ultimate highway with one late priceless car probing it    arriving In a square town    and off her starboard arm the glitter of water catches The moon by its one shaken side    scaled, roaming silver    My God it is good And evil    lying in one after another of all the positions for love Making    dancing    sleeping    and now cloud wisps at her no Raincoat    no matter    all small towns brokenly brighter from inside Cloud    she walks over them like rain    bursts out to behold a Greyhound Bus shooting light through its sides    it is the signal to go straight Down like a glorious diver    then feet first    her skirt stripped beautifully Up    her face in fear-scented cloths    her legs deliriously bare    then Arms out    she slow-rolls over    steadies out    waits for something great To take control of her    trembles near feathers    planes head-down The quick movements of bird-necks turning her head    gold eyes the insight- eyesight of owls blazing into the hencoops    a taste for chicken overwhelming Her    the long-range vision of hawks enlarging all human lights of cars Freight trains    looped bridges    enlarging the moon racing slowly Through all the curves of a river    all the darks of the midwest blazing From above. A rabbit in a bush turns white    the smothering chickens Huddle    for over them there is still time for something to live With the streaming half-idea of a long stoop    a hurtling    a fall That is controlled    that plummets as it wills    turns gravity Into a new condition, showing its other side like a moon    shining New Powers    there is still time to live on a breath made of nothing But the whole night    time for her to remember to arrange her skirt Like a diagram of a bat    tightly it guides her    she has this flying-skin Made of garments    and there are also those sky-divers on tv    sailing In sunlight    smiling under their goggles    swapping batons back and forth And He who jumped without a chute and was handed one by a diving Buddy. She looks for her grinning companion    white teeth    nowhere She is screaming    singing hymns    her thin human wings spread out From her neat shoulders    the air beast-crooning to her    warbling And she can no longer behold the huge partial form of the world    now She is watching her country lose its evoked master shape    watching it lose And gain    get back its houses and peoples    watching it bring up Its local lights    single homes    lamps on barn roofs    if she fell Into water she might live    like a diver    cleaving    perfect    plunge Into another    heavy silver    unbreathable    slowing    saving Element: there is water    there is time to perfect all the fine Points of diving    feet together    toes pointed    hands shaped right To insert her into water like a needle    to come out healthily dripping And be handed a Coca-Cola    there they are    there are the waters Of life    the moon packed and coiled in a reservoir    so let me begin To plane across

822	The Lifeguard	311		\nIn a stable of boats I lie still, From all sleeping children hidden.   The leap of a fish from its shadow   Makes the whole lake instantly tremble.   With my foot on the water, I feel   The moon outside Take on the utmost of its power. I rise and go out through the boats.   I set my broad sole upon silver, On the skin of the sky, on the moonlight,   Stepping outward from earth onto water   In quest of the miracle This village of children believed   That I could perform as I dived For one who had sunk from my sight.   I saw his cropped haircut go under.   I leapt, and my steep body flashed   Once, in the sun. Dark drew all the light from my eyes.   Like a man who explores his death By the pull of his slow-moving shoulders,   I hung head down in the cold, Wide-eyed, contained, and alone Among the weeds, And my fingertips turned into stone   From clutching immovable blackness.   Time after time I leapt upward Exploding in breath, and fell back   From the change in the children’s faces   At my defeat. Beneath them I swam to the boathouse   With only my life in my arms To wait for the lake to shine back At the risen moon with such power   That my steps on the light of the ripples   Might be sustained. Beneath me is nothing but brightness   Like the ghost of a snowfield in summer.   As I move toward the center of the lake,   Which is also the center of the moon,   I am thinking of how I may be The savior of one Who has already died in my care.   The dark trees fade from around me.   The moon’s dust hovers together.   I call softly out, and the child’s Voice answers through blinding water.   Patiently, slowly, He rises, dilating to break The surface of stone with his forehead.   He is one I do not remember Having ever seen in his life.

823	In the Tree House at Night	311		\nAnd now the green household is dark.   The half-moon completely is shining   On the earth-lighted tops of the trees.   To be dead, a house must be still. The floor and the walls wave me slowly;   I am deep in them over my head.   The needles and pine cones about me Are full of small birds at their roundest,   Their fists without mercy gripping Hard down through the tree to the roots   To sing back at light when they feel it.   We lie here like angels in bodies, My brothers and I, one dead, The other asleep from much living, In mid-air huddled beside me. Dark climbed to us here as we climbed Up the nails I have hammered all day Through the sprained, comic rungs of the ladder   Of broom handles, crate slats, and laths Foot by foot up the trunk to the branches   Where we came out at last over lakes Of leaves, of fields disencumbered of earth   That move with the moves of the spirit.   Each nail that sustains us I set here; Each nail in the house is now steadied By my dead brother’s huge, freckled hand.   Through the years, he has pointed his hammer   Up into these limbs, and told us That we must ascend, and all lie here.   Step after step he has brought me,   Embracing the trunk as his body, Shaking its limbs with my heartbeat,   Till the pine cones danced without wind   And fell from the branches like apples.   In the arm-slender forks of our dwelling I breathe my live brother’s light hair.   The blanket around us becomes As solid as stone, and it sways. With all my heart, I close The blue, timeless eye of my mind.   Wind springs, as my dead brother smiles   And touches the tree at the root; A shudder of joy runs up The trunk; the needles tingle;   One bird uncontrollably cries. The wind changes round, and I stir   Within another’s life. Whose life? Who is dead? Whose presence is living?   When may I fall strangely to earth, Who am nailed to this branch by a spirit?   Can two bodies make up a third? To sing, must I feel the world’s light?   My green, graceful bones fill the air   With sleeping birds. Alone, alone And with them I move gently. I move at the heart of the world.\n	'air':113,389 'alon':393,394 'angel':95 'anoth':339 'appl':259 'arm':263 'arm-slend':262 'around':279 'ascend':222 'asleep':106 'back':84 'becom':281 'besid':115 'bird':65,328,392 'blanket':278 'blue':296 'bodi':97,239,369 'bone':386 'branch':156,257,363 'breath':270 'broom':142 'brother':99,199,273,307 'brought':232 'came':159 'chang':333 'climb':118,124 'close':294 'comic':136 'complet':18 'cone':58,249 'crate':144 'cri':330 'danc':250 'dark':13,117 'day':132 'dead':32,103,198,306,346 'deep':48 'disencumb':169 'dwell':268 'earth':24,171,357 'earth-light':23 'embrac':234 'eye':298 'fall':354 'feel':89,378 'fell':254 'field':168 'fill':387 'fist':70 'floor':39 'foot':148,150 'fork':265 'freckl':202 'full':62 'gentl':400 'grace':385 'green':10,384 'grip':73 'hair':276 'half':16 'half-moon':15 'hammer':130,211 'hand':203 'handl':143 'hard':74 'head':53 'heart':292,405 'heartbeat':245 'hous':4,34,192 'household':11 'huddl':114 'huge':201 'joy':319 'ladder':140 'lake':164 'last':162 'lath':147 'leav':166 'lie':92,225 'life':341,343 'light':25,86,275,382 'like':94,258 'limb':215,242 'live':109,272,350 'make':370 'may':352 'merci':72 'mid':112 'mid-air':111 'mind':301 'moon':17 'move':173,176,399,402 'much':108 'must':35,221,376 'nail':127,181,189,360 'needl':55,325 'night':6 'one':102,327 'pine':57,248 'point':209 'presenc':348 'root':81,315 'round':334 'roundest':68 'run':320 'rung':137 'set':186 'shake':240 'shine':20 'shudder':317 'sing':83,375 'slat':145 'sleep':391 'slender':264 'slowli':45 'small':64 'smile':308 'solid':283 'spirit':179,366 'sprain':135 'spring':303 'steadi':195 'step':227,229 'still':37 'stir':337 'stone':285 'strang':355 'sustain':183 'sway':288 'third':373 'till':246 'timeless':297 'tingl':326 'told':217 'top':26 'touch':310 'tree':3,29,78,312 'trunk':153,236,323 'two':368 'uncontrol':329 'us':120,184,218,280 'wall':42 'wave':43 'whose':342,347 'wind':252,302,332 'within':338 'without':71,251 'world':380,408 'year':206
824	For the Last Wolverine	311		\nThey will soon be down To one, but he still will be For a little while    still will be stopping The flakes in the air with a look, Surrounding himself with the silence Of whitening snarls. Let him eat The last red meal of the condemned To extinction, tearing the guts From an elk. Yet that is not enough For me. I would have him eat The heart, and from it, have an idea Stream into his gnarling head That he no longer has a thing To lose, and so can walk Out into the open, in the full Pale of the sub-Arctic sun Where a single spruce tree is dying Higher and higher. Let him climb it With all his meanness and strength. Lord, we have come to the end Of this kind of vision of heaven, As the sky breaks open Its fans around him and shimmers And into its northern gates he rises Snarling    complete    in the joy of a weasel With an elk’s horned heart in his stomach Looking straight into the eternal Blue, where he hauls his kind. I would have it all My way: at the top of that tree I place The New World’s last eagle Hunched in mangy feathers    giving Up on the theory of flight. Dear God of the wildness of poetry, let them mate To the death in the rotten branches, Let the tree sway and burst into flame And mingle them, crackling with feathers, In crownfire. Let something come Of it    something gigantic    legendary Rise beyond reason over hills Of ice    screaming    that it cannot die, That it has come back, this time On wings, and will spare no earthly thing: That it will hover, made purely of northern Lights, at dusk    and fall On men building roads: will perch On the moose’s horn like a falcon Riding into battle    into holy war against Screaming railroad crews: will pull Whole traplines like fibres from the snow In the long-jawed night of fur trappers. But, small, filthy, unwinged, You will soon be crouching Alone, with maybe some dim racial notion Of being the last, but none of how much Your unnoticed going will mean: How much the timid poem needs The mindless explosion of your rage, The glutton’s internal fire    the elk’s Heart in the belly, sprouting wings, The pact of the “blind swallowing Thing,” with himself, to eat The world, and not to be driven off it Until it is gone, even if it takes Forever. I take you as you are And make of you what I will, Skunk-bear, carcajoy, bloodthirsty Non-survivor.                         Lord, let me die    but not die Out.\n	'air':29 'alon':355 'arctic':109 'around':152 'back':280 'battl':320 'bear':446 'belli':399 'beyond':265 'blind':406 'bloodthirsti':448 'blue':185 'branch':239 'break':148 'build':306 'burst':245 'cannot':274 'carcajoy':447 'climb':123 'come':134,258,279 'complet':164 'condemn':50 'crackl':251 'crew':327 'crouch':354 'crownfir':255 'dear':223 'death':235 'die':117,275,455,458 'dim':359 'driven':419 'dusk':301 'eagl':211 'earth':289 'eat':43,70,412 'elk':58,173,394 'end':137 'enough':63 'etern':184 'even':426 'explos':384 'extinct':52 'falcon':317 'fall':303 'fan':151 'feather':215,253 'fibr':333 'filthi':348 'fire':392 'flake':26 'flame':247 'flight':222 'forev':430 'full':103 'fur':344 'gate':160 'gigant':262 'give':216 'glutton':389 'gnarl':82 'go':373 'god':224 'gone':425 'gut':55 'haul':188 'head':83 'heart':72,176,396 'heaven':144 'higher':118,120 'hill':268 'holi':322 'horn':175,314 'hover':294 'hunch':212 'ice':270 'idea':78 'intern':391 'jaw':341 'joy':167 'kind':140,190 'last':3,45,210,365 'legendari':263 'let':41,121,230,240,256,453 'light':299 'like':315,332 'littl':19 'long':340 'long-jaw':339 'longer':87 'look':32,180 'lord':131,452 'lose':92 'made':295 'make':438 'mangi':214 'mate':232 'mayb':357 'meal':47 'mean':128,375 'men':305 'mindless':383 'mingl':249 'moos':312 'much':370,377 'need':381 'new':207 'night':342 'non':450 'non-survivor':449 'none':367 'northern':159,298 'notion':361 'one':11 'open':100,149 'pact':403 'pale':104 'perch':309 'place':205 'poem':380 'poetri':229 'pull':329 'pure':296 'racial':360 'rage':387 'railroad':326 'reason':266 'red':46 'ride':318 'rise':162,264 'road':307 'rotten':238 'scream':271,325 'shimmer':155 'silenc':37 'singl':113 'skunk':445 'skunk-bear':444 'sky':147 'small':347 'snarl':40,163 'snow':336 'someth':257,261 'soon':7,352 'spare':287 'sprout':400 'spruce':114 'still':14,21 'stomach':179 'stop':24 'straight':181 'stream':79 'strength':130 'sub':108 'sub-arct':107 'sun':110 'surround':33 'survivor':451 'swallow':407 'sway':243 'take':429,432 'tear':53 'theori':220 'thing':90,290,408 'time':282 'timid':379 'top':200 'traplin':331 'trapper':345 'tree':115,203,242 'unnot':372 'unwing':349 'vision':142 'walk':96 'war':323 'way':197 'weasel':170 'whiten':39 'whole':330 'wild':227 'wing':284,401 'wolverin':4 'world':208,414 'would':67,192 'yet':59
825	At Darien Bridge	311		\nThe sea here used to look As if many convicts had built it, Standing deep in their ankle chains,   Ankle-deep in the water, to smite The land and break it down to salt.   I was in this bog as a child When they were all working all day   To drive the pilings down. I thought I saw the still sun Strike the side of a hammer in flight And from it a sea bird be born   To take off over the marshes.

827	The Hospital Window	311		\nI have just come down from my father. Higher and higher he lies Above me in a blue light Shed by a tinted window. I drop through six white floors And then step out onto pavement. Still feeling my father ascend, I start to cross the firm street, My shoulder blades shining with all The glass the huge building can raise. Now I must turn round and face it, And know his one pane from the others. Each window possesses the sun As though it burned there on a wick. I wave, like a man catching fire. All the deep-dyed windowpanes flash, And, behind them, all the white rooms They turn to the color of Heaven. Ceremoniously, gravely, and weakly, Dozens of pale hands are waving Back, from inside their flames. Yet one pure pane among these Is the bright, erased blankness of nothing. I know that my father is there, In the shape of his death still living. The traffic increases around me Like a madness called down on my head. The horns blast at me like shotguns, And drivers lean out, driven crazy— But now my propped-up father Lifts his arm out of stillness at last. The light from the window strikes me And I turn as blue as a soul, As the moment when I was born. I am not afraid for my father— Look! He is grinning; he is not Afraid for my life, either, As the wild engines stand at my knees Shredding their gears and roaring, And I hold each car in its place For miles, inciting its horn To blow down the walls of the world That the dying may float without fear In the bold blue gaze of my father. Slowly I move to the sidewalk With my pin-tingling hand half dead At the end of my bloodless arm. I carry it off in amazement, High, still higher, still waving, My recognized face fully mortal, Yet not; not at all, in the pale, Drained, otherworldly, stricken, Created hue of stained glass. I have just come down from my father.\n	'afraid':231,242 'amaz':322 'among':141 'arm':200,316 'around':168 'ascend':44 'back':132 'behind':109 'blade':54 'blank':147 'blast':180 'bloodless':315 'blow':274 'blue':21,217,291 'bold':290 'born':227 'bright':145 'build':62 'burn':89 'call':173 'car':264 'carri':318 'catch':99 'ceremoni':122 'color':119 'come':7,352 'crazi':190 'creat':344 'cross':48 'dead':309 'death':162 'deep':104 'deep-di':103 'die':283 'dozen':126 'drain':341 'driven':189 'driver':186 'drop':29 'dy':105 'either':246 'end':312 'engin':250 'eras':146 'face':71,330 'father':11,43,154,197,234,295,356 'fear':287 'feel':41 'fire':100 'firm':50 'flame':136 'flash':107 'float':285 'floor':33 'fulli':331 'gaze':292 'gear':257 'glass':59,348 'grave':123 'grin':238 'half':308 'hand':129,307 'head':177 'heaven':121 'high':323 'higher':12,14,325 'hold':262 'horn':179,272 'hospit':2 'hue':345 'huge':61 'incit':270 'increas':167 'insid':134 'knee':254 'know':74,151 'last':205 'lean':187 'lie':16 'life':245 'lift':198 'light':22,207 'like':96,170,183 'live':164 'look':235 'mad':172 'man':98 'may':284 'mile':269 'moment':223 'mortal':332 'move':298 'must':67 'noth':149 'one':76,138 'onto':38 'other':80 'otherworld':342 'pale':128,340 'pane':77,140 'pavement':39 'pin':305 'pin-tingl':304 'place':267 'possess':83 'prop':195 'propped-up':194 'pure':139 'rais':64 'recogn':329 'roar':259 'room':114 'round':69 'shape':159 'shed':23 'shine':55 'shotgun':184 'shoulder':53 'shred':255 'sidewalk':301 'six':31 'slowli':296 'soul':220 'stain':347 'stand':251 'start':46 'step':36 'still':40,163,203,324,326 'street':51 'stricken':343 'strike':211 'sun':85 'though':87 'tingl':306 'tint':26 'traffic':166 'turn':68,116,215 'wall':277 'wave':95,131,327 'weak':125 'white':32,113 'wick':93 'wild':249 'window':3,27,82,210 'windowpan':106 'without':286 'world':280 'yet':137,333

831	Montana Pastoral	310		\nI am no shepherd of a child’s surmises. I have seen fear where the coiled serpent rises, Thirst where the grasses burn in early May And thistle, mustard, and the wild oat stay. There is dust in this air. I saw in the heat Grasshoppers busy in the threshing wheat. So to this hour. Through the warm dusk I drove To blizzards sifting on the hissing stove, And found no images of pastoral will, But fear, thirst, hunger, and this huddled chill.\n	'air':42 'blizzard':65 'burn':25 'busi':49 'child':9 'chill':85 'coil':18 'drove':63 'dusk':61 'dust':39 'earli':27 'fear':15,79 'found':72 'grass':24 'grasshopp':48 'heat':47 'hiss':69 'hour':57 'huddl':84 'hunger':81 'imag':74 'may':28 'montana':1 'mustard':31 'oat':35 'pastor':2,76 'rise':20 'saw':44 'seen':14 'serpent':19 'shepherd':6 'sift':66 'stay':36 'stove':70 'surmis':11 'thirst':21,80 'thistl':30 'thresh':52 'warm':60 'wheat':53 'wild':34

833	The Metaphysical Amorist	310		\nYou are the problem I propose, My dear, the text my musings glose: I call you for convenience love. By definition you’re a cause Inferred by necessary laws— You are so to the saints above. But in this shadowy lower life I sleep with a terrestrial wife And earthy children I beget. Love is a fiction I must use, A privilege I can abuse, And sometimes something I forget. Now, in the heavenly other place Love is in the eternal mind The luminous form whose shade she is, A ghost discarnate, thought defined. She was so to my early bliss, She is so while I comprehend The forms my senses apprehend, And in the end she will be so. Her whom my hands embrace I kiss, Her whom my mind infers I know. The one exists in time and space And as she was she will not be; The other is in her own grace And is She is eternally. Plato! you shall not plague my life. I married a terrestrial wife. And Hume! she is not mere sensation In sequence of observed relation. She has two forms—ah, thank you, Duns!—, I know her in both ways at once. I knew her, yes, before I knew her, And by both means I must construe her, And none among you shall undo her.\n	'abus':68 'ah':193 'among':223 'amorist':3 'apprehend':115 'beget':56 'bliss':104 'call':18 'caus':28 'children':54 'comprehend':110 'constru':219 'conveni':21 'dear':11 'defin':97 'definit':24 'discarn':95 'dun':196 'earli':103 'earthi':53 'embrac':128 'end':119 'etern':84,164 'exist':140 'fiction':60 'forget':73 'form':88,112,192 'ghost':94 'glose':16 'grace':159 'hand':127 'heaven':77 'hume':178 'infer':29,135 'kiss':130 'knew':206,211 'know':137,198 'law':32 'life':45,171 'love':22,57,80 'lower':44 'lumin':87 'marri':173 'mean':216 'mere':182 'metaphys':2 'mind':85,134 'muse':15 'must':62,218 'necessari':31 'none':222 'observ':187 'one':139 'place':79 'plagu':169 'plato':165 'privileg':65 'problem':7 'propos':9 're':26 'relat':188 'saint':38 'sens':114 'sensat':183 'sequenc':185 'shade':90 'shadowi':43 'shall':167,225 'sleep':47 'someth':71 'sometim':70 'space':144 'terrestri':50,175 'text':13 'thank':194 'thought':96 'time':142 'two':191 'undo':226 'use':63 'way':202 'whose':89 'wife':51,176 'yes':208

839	The Homecoming Singer	312		\nThe plane tilts in to Nashville,  coming over the green lights  like a toy train skipping past  the signals on a track. The city is livid with lights, as if the weight of all the people  shooting down her arteries  had inflamed them. It's Friday night, and people are home for the homecomings.  As I come into the terminal, a young black man, in a vested gray suit,  paces in the florid Tennessee air, breaks into a run like a halfback in open field, going past the delirious faces,  past the poster of Molly Bee in her shiny chaps, her hips tilted forward  where the guns would be, her legs set, as if she would run, as if she were a cheerleader who doffs her guns on Saturday afternoon and careens down the sidelines after some broken field runner,  who carries it in, for now, for all the state of Tennessee with its nut-smelling trees, its stolid little stone walls set out under thick blankets of leaves,  its crisp lights dangling on the porches of homes that top the graveled driveways,  where people who cannot yodel or yell  putter in the grave October afternoons,  waiting for Saturday night and the lights  that spatter on Molly Bee's silver chaps.  I don't want to think of them, or even of the broken field runner in the terminal,  still looking for his girl, his pocket full of dates and parties, as I come into this Friday night of homecomings  and hobble over the highway in a taxi  that has its radio tuned to country music.  I come up to the campus, with a large wreath jutting up under the elegant dormitories, where one girl sits looking down at the shrieking cars,  as the lights go out, one by one, around her  and the laughter drifts off, rising, rising,  as if it would take flight away from the livid arteries of Nashville. Now, in sleep, I leave my brass-headed bed,  and see her enter with tall singers, they in African shirts, she in a robe.  She sits among them, as a golden lance  catches her, suddenly chubby, with soft lips  and unhurried eyes, quite still in the movement  around her, waiting, as the other voices fade,  as the movement stops, and starts to sing,  her voice moving up from its tart entrance until it swings as freely as an ecstatic dancer's foot, rises and plays among the windows it would with angels and falls,  almost visible, to return to her, and leave her shaking with the tears  I'm ashamed to release, and leave her  twisting there on that stool with my shame  for the livid arteries, the flat Saturdays,  the inhuman homecomings of Nashville.  I kneel before her. She strokes my hair,  as softly as she would a cat's head,  and goes on singing, her voice shifting  and bringing up the Carolina calls,  the waterboy, the railroad cutter, the jailed,  the condemned, all that had been forgotten  on this night of homecomings, all that had been misplaced in those livid arteries.  She finishes, and leaves, her shy head tilted and wrinkled in the green-tinged lights of the still campus.  I close my eyes and listen, as she goes out to sing this city home.\n	'african':346 'afternoon':133,200 'air':78 'almost':422 'among':354,413 'angel':419 'around':305,375 'arteri':43,324,454,520 'asham':437 'away':320 'bed':336 'bee':99,212 'black':66 'blanket':171 'brass':334 'brass-head':333 'break':79 'bring':488 'broken':141,228 'call':492 'campus':276,540 'cannot':191 'car':296 'careen':135 'carolina':491 'carri':145 'cat':477 'catch':360 'chap':103,215 'cheerlead':126 'chubbi':363 'citi':27,554 'close':542 'come':10,60,248,272 'condemn':501 'countri':269 'crisp':175 'cutter':497 'dancer':407 'dangl':177 'date':243 'deliri':92 'doff':128 'dormitori':286 'drift':310 'driveway':187 'ecstat':406 'eleg':285 'enter':340 'entranc':398 'even':225 'eye':369,544 'face':93 'fade':382 'fall':421 'field':88,142,229 'finish':522 'flat':456 'flight':319 'florid':76 'foot':409 'forgotten':506 'forward':107 'freeli':403 'friday':49,251 'full':241 'girl':238,289 'go':89,300 'goe':481,549 'golden':358 'grave':198 'gravel':186 'gray':71 'green':13,534 'green-ting':533 'gun':110,130 'hair':470 'halfback':85 'head':335,479,527 'highway':259 'hip':105 'hobbl':256 'home':54,182,555 'homecom':2,57,254,460,511 'inflam':45 'inhuman':459 'jail':499 'jut':281 'kneel':464 'lanc':359 'larg':279 'laughter':309 'leav':173,331,429,441,524 'leg':114 'light':14,31,176,207,299,536 'like':15,83 'lip':366 'listen':546 'littl':164 'livid':29,323,453,519 'look':235,291 'm':436 'man':67 'misplac':516 'molli':98,211 'move':393 'movement':374,385 'music':270 'nashvill':9,326,462 'night':50,204,252,509 'nut':159 'nut-smel':158 'octob':199 'one':288,302,304 'open':87 'pace':73 'parti':245 'past':20,90,94 'peopl':39,52,189 'plane':5 'play':412 'pocket':240 'porch':180 'poster':96 'putter':195 'quit':370 'radio':266 'railroad':496 'releas':439 'return':425 'rise':312,313,410 'robe':351 'run':82,120 'runner':143,230 'saturday':132,203,457 'see':338 'set':115,167 'shake':431 'shame':450 'shi':526 'shift':486 'shini':102 'shirt':347 'shoot':40 'shriek':295 'sidelin':138 'signal':22 'silver':214 'sing':390,483,552 'singer':3,343 'sit':290,353 'skip':19 'sleep':329 'smell':160 'soft':365,472 'spatter':209 'start':388 'state':153 'still':234,371,539 'stolid':163 'stone':165 'stool':447 'stop':386 'stroke':468 'sudden':362 'suit':72 'swing':401 'take':318 'tall':342 'tart':397 'taxi':262 'tear':434 'tennesse':77,155 'termin':63,233 'thick':170 'think':221 'tilt':6,106,528 'ting':535 'top':184 'toy':17 'track':25 'train':18 'tree':161 'tune':267 'twist':443 'unhurri':368 'vest':70 'visibl':423 'voic':381,392,485 'wait':201,377 'wall':166 'want':219 'waterboy':494 'weight':35 'window':415 'would':111,119,317,417,475 'wreath':280 'wrinkl':530 'yell':194 'yodel':192 'young':65
847	Meta-A and the A of Absolutes	312		\nI write my God in blue. I run my gods upstream on flimsy rafts. I bathe my goddesses in foam, in moonlight. I take my reasons from my mother's snuff breath,  or from an old woman, sitting with a lemonade,  at twilight, on the desert's steps. Brown by day and black by night, my God has wings that open to no reason. He scutters from the touch of old men's eyes,  scutters from the smell of wisdom, an orb  of light leaping from a fire. Press him he bleeds. When you take your hand to sacred water,  there is no sign of any wound. And so I call him supreme, great artist,  judge of time, scholar of all living event,  the possible prophet of the possible event.  Blind men, on bourbon, with guitars,  blind men with their scars dulled by kola,  blind men seeking the shelter of a raindrop,  blind men in corn, blind men in steel,  reason by their lights that our tongues  are free, our tongues will redeem us.  Speech is the fact, and the fact is true.  What is moves, and what is moving is.  We cling to these contradictions. We know we will become our contradictions,  our complex body's own desire. Yet speech is not the limit of our vision.  The ear entices itself with any sound.  The skin will caress whatever tone  or temperament that rises or descends.  The bones will set themselves to a dance.  The blood will argue with a bird in flight. The heart will scale the dew from an old chalice,  brush and thrill to an old bone. And yet there is no sign to arrest us                                      from the possible. We remain at rest there, in transit from our knowing to our knowledge. So I would set a limit where I meet my logic.  I would clamber from my own cave into the curve of sign, an alphabet of transformation, the clan's cloak of reason.  I am good when I am in motion, when I think of myself at rest in the knowledge of my moving, when I have the vision of my mother at rest, in moonlight, her lap the cradle of my father's head.  I am good when I trade my shells, and walk from boundary to boundary,  unarmed and unafraid of another's speech.  I am good when I learn the world through the touch of my present body.  I am good when I take the cove of a cub                                              into my care. I am good when I hear the changes in my body  echo all my changes down the years, when what I know indeed is what I would                                               know in deed.

841	Benjamin Banneker Sends His “Almanac” to Thomas Jefferson	312		\nOld now, your eyes nearly blank  from plotting the light's movement over the years,  you clean your Almanac and place it next to the heart of this letter.  I have you in mind, giving a final brush and twist  to the difficult pages, staring down the shape of the numbers  as though you would find a flaw  in their forms. Solid, these calculations verify your body on God's earth.  At night, the stars submit themselves to the remembered way you turn them;  the moon gloats under your attention. I, who know so little of stars, whose only acquaintance with the moon  is to read a myth, or to listen  to the surge of songs the women know,  sit in your marvelous reading  of all movement, of all relations. So you look into what we see  yet cannot see, and shape and take a language  to give form to one or the other,  believing no form will escape,  no movement appear, nor stop,  without explanation, believing no reason is only reason,  nor without reason. I read all of this into your task,  all of this into the uneasy  reproof of your letter. Surely, there must be a flaw. These perfect calculations fall apart. There are silences that no perfect number can retrieve, omissions no perfect line could catch.  How could a man but challenge God's impartial distributions? How could a man sit among the free and ordered movements of stars, and waters, beasts and birds,  each movement seen or accounted for,  and not know God jealous, and not know that he himself must be? So you go over the pages again, looking for the one thing that will not reveal itself, judging what you have received, what you have shaped, believing it cannot be strange to the man you address. But you are strange to him —your skin, your tongue, the movement of your body, even your mysterious ways with stars.  You argue here with the man and God,  and know that no man can be right,  and know that no God will argue right.  Your letter turns on what the man knows, on what God, you think, would have us know.  All stars will forever move under your gaze,  truthfully, leading you from line to line,  from number to number, from truth to truth,  while the man will read your soul's desire,  searcher, searching yourself, losing the relations.\n	'account':260 'acquaint':108 'address':310 'almanac':5,27 'among':243 'apart':212 'appear':170 'argu':333,354 'attent':98 'bannek':2 'beast':253 'believ':163,175,301 'benjamin':1 'bird':255 'blank':14 'bodi':75,325 'brush':46 'calcul':72,210 'cannot':147,303 'catch':227 'challeng':233 'clean':25 'could':226,229,239 'desir':404 'difficult':51 'distribut':237 'earth':79 'escap':167 'even':326 'explan':174 'eye':12 'fall':211 'final':45 'find':64 'flaw':66,207 'forev':376 'form':69,157,165 'free':245 'gaze':380 'give':43,156 'gloat':95 'go':277 'god':77,234,265,339,352,366 'heart':34 'imparti':236 'jealous':266 'jefferson':8 'judg':292 'know':101,127,264,269,341,349,363,372 'languag':154 'lead':382 'letter':37,201,357 'light':18 'line':225,385,387 'listen':119 'littl':103 'look':141,282 'lose':408 'man':231,241,308,337,344,362,398 'marvel':131 'mind':42 'moon':94,111 'move':377 'movement':20,135,169,248,257,322 'must':204,273 'mysteri':328 'myth':116 'near':13 'next':31 'night':81 'number':59,219,389,391 'old':9 'omiss':222 'one':159,285 'order':247 'page':52,280 'perfect':209,218,224 'place':29 'plot':16 'read':114,132,185,400 'reason':177,180,183 'receiv':296 'relat':138,410 'rememb':88 'reproof':198 'retriev':221 'reveal':290 'right':347,355 'search':406 'searcher':405 'see':145,148 'seen':258 'send':3 'shape':56,150,300 'silenc':215 'sit':128,242 'skin':318 'solid':70 'song':124 'soul':402 'star':83,105,250,331,374 'stare':53 'stop':172 'strang':305,314 'submit':84 'sure':202 'surg':122 'take':152 'task':191 'thing':286 'think':368 'thoma':7 'though':61 'tongu':320 'truth':381,393,395 'turn':91,358 'twist':48 'uneasi':197 'us':371 'verifi':73 'water':252 'way':89,329 'whose':106 'without':173,182 'women':126 'would':63,369 'year':23 'yet':146
842	Journey to the Place of Ghosts	312		\nDeath knocks all night at my door. The soul answers, and runs from the water in my throat.  Water will sustain me when I climb                                    the steep hill that leads to a now familiar place. I began, even as a child, to learn water's order,  and, as I grew intact, the feel of its warmth in a new sponge, of its weight in a virgin towel.  I have earned my wine in another's misery,  when rum bathed a sealed throat and cast its seal on the ground. I will be bound, to the one who leads me away,  by the ornaments on my wrists, the gold dust  in my ears, below my eye and tied to my                         loincloth in a leather pouch.  They dress me now in my best cloth,  and fold my hands, adorned with silk,                             against my left cheek.  Gold lies with me on my left side. Gold has become the color of distance,                                and of your sorrow. Sorrow lies, red clay on my brow. Red pepper caresses my temples. I am adorned in the russet-brown message  the soul brings from its coming-to-be.  There is a silken despair in my body that grief shakes from it, a cat's voice, controlled by palm wine                                  and a widow's passion. It is time to feed the soul          —a hen, eggs, mashed yams— and encourage the thirst resting near the right hand I see before me.                   Always I think of death.                             I cannot eat.                   I walk in sadness, and I die. Yet life is the invocation sealed in the coffin,  and will walk through our wall, passing and passing and passing,                      until it is set down, to be lifted from this body's habitation.  I now assume the widow's pot, the lamp that will lead me through solitude,  to the edge of my husband's journey. I hold three stones upon my head, darkness I will release when I run from the dead, with my eyes turned away                      toward another light. This is the day of rising. A hut sits in the bush, sheltered by summe,  standing on four forked ends. We have prepared for the soul's feast  with pestle, mortar, a strainer, three  hearthstones, a new pot and new spoon.  Someone has stripped the hut's body  and dressed it with the edowa. Now, when the wine speaks and the fire has lifted its voice, the dead will be clothed in hair,                         the signs of our grief. Sun closes down on an intensity of ghosts.  It is time to close the path. It is time for the snail's pace of coming again into life,                with the world swept clean,                the crying done, and our ordinary garments decent in the dead one's eyes.\n	'adorn':143,183 'alway':250 'anoth':80,344 'answer':16 'assum':300 'away':106,342 'bath':85 'becom':160 'began':43 'best':137 'bodi':206,295,393 'bound':99 'bring':192 'brow':175 'brown':188 'bush':357 'cannot':256 'caress':178 'cast':90 'cat':213 'cheek':149 'child':47 'clay':172 'clean':456 'climb':31 'close':425,436 'cloth':138,416 'coffin':273 'color':162 'come':196,448 'coming-to-b':195 'control':216 'cri':458 'dark':328 'day':349 'dead':337,413,467 'death':7,254 'decent':464 'despair':203 'die':264 'distanc':164 'done':459 'door':13 'dress':132,395 'dust':115 'ear':118 'earn':76 'eat':257 'edg':315 'edowa':399 'egg':234 'encourag':238 'end':365 'even':44 'eye':121,340,470 'familiar':40 'feast':373 'feed':229 'feel':59 'fire':407 'fold':140 'fork':364 'four':363 'garment':463 'ghost':6,431 'gold':114,150,158 'grew':56 'grief':208,423 'ground':95 'habit':297 'hair':418 'hand':142,245 'head':327 'hearthston':380 'hen':233 'hill':34 'hold':322 'husband':318 'hut':353,391 'intact':57 'intens':429 'invoc':269 'journey':1,320 'knock':8 'lamp':306 'lead':36,104,309 'learn':49 'leather':129 'left':148,156 'lie':151,170 'life':266,451 'lift':292,409 'light':345 'loincloth':126 'mash':235 'messag':189 'miseri':82 'mortar':376 'near':242 'new':65,382,385 'night':10 'one':102,468 'order':52 'ordinari':462 'ornament':109 'pace':446 'palm':218 'pass':280,282,284 'passion':224 'path':438 'pepper':177 'pestl':375 'place':4,41 'pot':304,383 'pouch':130 'prepar':368 'red':171,176 'releas':331 'rest':241 'right':244 'rise':351 'rum':84 'run':18,334 'russet':187 'russet-brown':186 'sad':261 'seal':87,92,270 'see':247 'set':288 'shake':209 'shelter':358 'side':157 'sign':420 'silk':145 'silken':202 'sit':354 'snail':444 'solitud':312 'someon':387 'sorrow':168,169 'soul':15,191,231,371 'speak':404 'spong':66 'spoon':386 'stand':361 'steep':33 'stone':324 'strainer':378 'strip':389 'summ':360 'sun':424 'sustain':27 'swept':455 'templ':180 'think':252 'thirst':240 'three':323,379 'throat':24,88 'tie':123 'time':227,434,441 'toward':343 'towel':73 'turn':341 'upon':325 'virgin':72 'voic':215,411 'walk':259,276 'wall':279 'warmth':62 'water':21,25,50 'weight':69 'widow':222,302 'wine':78,219,403 'world':454 'wrist':112 'yam':236 'yet':265
843	The Cradle Logic of Autumn	312		\nEach instant comes with a price, the blue-edged bill  on the draft of a bird almost incarnadine,  the shanked ochre of an inn that sits as still  as the beavertail cactus it guards (the fine  rose of that flower gone as bronze as sand),  the river's chalky white insistence as it  moves past the gray afternoon toward sunset.  Autumn feels the chill of a late summer lit  only by goldenrod and a misplaced strand  of blackberries; deplores all such sleight of hand;  turns sullen, selfish, envious, full of regret. Someone more adept would mute its voice. The spill  of its truncated experience would shine less bravely and, out of the dust and dunghill  of this existence (call it hope, in decline), as here the blue light of autumn falls, command  what is left of exhilaration and fit this season's unfolding to the alphabet of turn and counterturn, all that implicit  arc of a heart searching for a place to stand.  Yet even that diminished voice can withstand  the currying of its spirit. Here lies—not yet. If, and only if, the leafless rose he sees, or thinks he sees, flowered a moment ago, this endangered heart flows with the river that flees  the plain, and listens with eye raised to the slow  revelation of cloud, hoping to approve  himself, or to admonish the rose for slight  transgressions of the past, this the ecstatic  ethos, a logic that seems set to reprove  his facility with unsettling delight. Autumn might be only desire, a Twelfth Night  gone awry, a gift almost too emphatic. Logic in a faithful light somehow appeases  the rose, and stirs the hummingbird's vibrato.  By moving, I can stand where the light eases  me into the river's feathered arms, and, so,  with the heat of my devotion, again prove  devotion, if not this moment, pure, finite.  Autumn cradles me with idiomatic certainty, leaves me nothing to disapprove.

844	The Healing Improvisation of Hair	312		\nIf you undo your do you would be strange. Hair has been on my mind.  I used to lean in the doorway and watch my stony woman wind the copper through the black, and play with my understanding, show me she cóuld  take a cup of river water, and watch it shimmy, watch it change, turn around and become ash bone.  Wind in the cottonwoods wakes me  to a day so thin its breastbone  shows, so paid out it shakes me free  of its blue dust. I will arrange  that river water, bottom juice.  I conjure my head in the stream  and ride with the silk feel of it as my woman bathes me, and shaves  away the scorn, sponges the grit  of solitude from my skin, laves  the salt water of self-esteem  over my feathering body. How like joy to come upon me  in remembering a head of hair  and the way water would caress  it, and stress beauty in the flair  and cut of the only witness to my dance under sorrow's tree. This swift darkness is spring's first hour. I carried my life, like a stone,  in a ragged pocket, but I had a true weaving song, a sly  way with rhythm, a healing tone.\n	'around':62 'arrang':94 'ash':65 'away':122 'bath':118 'beauti':167 'becom':64 'black':38 'blue':90 'bodi':144 'bone':66 'bottom':98 'breastbon':79 'caress':163 'carri':193 'chang':60 'come':149 'conjur':101 'copper':35 'cottonwood':70 'cup':50 'cut':172 'cóuld':47 'danc':179 'dark':186 'day':75 'doorway':27 'dust':91 'esteem':140 'feather':143 'feel':112 'first':190 'flair':170 'free':87 'grit':127 'hair':5,15,157 'head':103,155 'heal':2,216 'hour':191 'improvis':3 'joy':147 'juic':99 'lave':133 'lean':24 'life':195 'like':146,196 'mind':20 'paid':82 'play':40 'pocket':202 'rag':201 'rememb':153 'rhythm':214 'ride':108 'river':52,96 'salt':135 'scorn':124 'self':139 'self-esteem':138 'shake':85 'shave':121 'shimmi':57 'show':44,80 'silk':111 'skin':132 'sli':211 'solitud':129 'song':209 'sorrow':181 'spong':125 'spring':188 'stone':198 'stoni':31 'strang':14 'stream':106 'stress':166 'swift':185 'take':48 'thin':77 'tone':217 'tree':183 'true':207 'turn':61 'understand':43 'undo':8 'upon':150 'use':22 'wake':71 'watch':29,55,58 'water':53,97,136,161 'way':160,212 'weav':208 'wind':33,67 'wit':176 'woman':32,117 'would':12,162
845	The End of an Ethnic Dream	312		\nCigarettes in my mouth to puncture blisters in my brain.  My bass a fine piece of furniture.  My fingers soft, too soft to rattle  rafters in second-rate halls. The harmonies I could never learn  stick in Ayler's screams. An African chant chokes us. My image shot. If you look off over the Hudson, the dark cooperatives spit at the dinghies  floating up the night.                 A young boy pisses on lovers rolling against each other  under a trackless el.          This could have been my town, with light strings that could stand a tempo.                   Now,                   it's the end                   of an ethnic dream. I've grown intellectual, go on accumulating furniture and books,  damning literature, writing “for myself,”  calculating the possibilities that someone  will love me, or sleep with me. Eighteen-year-old girls come back from the Southern  leers and make me cry.                   Here, there are                   coffee shops, bars,                   natural tonsorial parlors,                    plays, streets,                   pamphlets, days, sun,                   heat, love, anger,                    politics, days, and sun. Here, we shoot off every day to new horizons,  coffee shops, bars, natural tonsorial parlors,  plays, streets, pamphlets, days, sun, heat, love, anger, politics, days, and sun.                   It is the end of an ethnic dream.                    My bass a fine piece of furniture.                    My brain blistered.\n	'accumul':117 'african':49 'anger':169,196 'ayler':45 'back':144 'bar':158,185 'bass':18,210 'blister':13,218 'book':120 'boy':76 'brain':16,217 'calcul':126 'chant':50 'choke':51 'cigarett':7 'coffe':156,183 'come':143 'cooper':65 'could':40,89,98 'cri':152 'damn':121 'dark':64 'day':165,171,179,192,198 'dinghi':69 'dream':6,110,208 'eighteen':139 'eighteen-year-old':138 'el':87 'end':2,106,204 'ethnic':5,109,207 'everi':178 'fine':20,212 'finger':25 'float':70 'furnitur':23,118,215 'girl':142 'go':115 'grown':113 'hall':36 'harmoni':38 'heat':167,194 'horizon':182 'hudson':62 'imag':54 'intellectu':114 'learn':42 'leer':148 'light':95 'literatur':122 'look':58 'love':132,168,195 'lover':79 'make':150 'mouth':10 'natur':159,186 'never':41 'new':181 'night':73 'old':141 'pamphlet':164,191 'parlor':161,188 'piec':21,213 'piss':77 'play':162,189 'polit':170,197 'possibl':128 'punctur':12 'rafter':31 'rate':35 'rattl':30 'roll':80 'scream':47 'second':34 'second-r':33 'shoot':176 'shop':157,184 'shot':55 'sleep':135 'soft':26,28 'someon':130 'southern':147 'spit':66 'stand':99 'stick':43 'street':163,190 'string':96 'sun':166,173,193,200 'tempo':101 'tonsori':160,187 'town':93 'trackless':86 'us':52 've':112 'write':123 'year':140 'young':75
846	Homecoming	312		\nThe trees are crystal chandeliers,  and deep in the hollow a child pits its voice against the rain. The city screams its prayers  at the towers in the distance. Those guitars again. And the Catholic mantis  clutching at the sky, a pearl of a city, cuando se duerme. Subway blue boys now ride shotgun against my freedom and my fears.  Pistols snap like indignant heels, at midday, and we stand at the docks,  singing a farewell we'd soon forget. Hymns resound against that dome  entre la fiesta y la agonia. Worms feed on its concrete, or we pluck them out of bodies. But time to forget. Or remember the easiness  of leaving easy loves, disappearing in the arms of secret dreams. We'll sit at the end  of a banquet board, and powder our tutored wigs, flip the pages of gentility in the rainy season. English lessons over tea  for the price of memory.          Il mio supplizio           è quando          non mi credo           in armonia. They say the time is not much different. The strange and customary turns  of living may coincide. In Mariachi Plaza travelers sing elegies to the beauty  of revolutions and tranquillity. From the opposite side of the river,  coming in, the skyline seems scrubbed  and pointed ominously into the darkness. I walk through the market,  kissing colors in a murmur  of self-induced petition. Two spires, lying against the night, are suddenly armed to sail. The water foams against the bottom,  the way it looked when I left that dying city Only a turning to feel the bark slope off into the night, with a promise to return.          Un di, s'io non andrò sempre fuggendo           di gente in gente, mi vedrai seduto          su la tua pietra, o fratel mio, gemendo           it fior dei tuoi gentili anni caduto. From line to line,  from point to point, is an architect's end of cities.

848	The Lake in Central Park	312		\nIt should have a woman's name, something to tell us how the green skirt of land                                            has bound its hips. When the day lowers its vermilion tapestry over the west ridge,  the water has the sound of leaves shaken in a sack,  and the child's voice that you have heard below                                                           sings of the sea. By slow movements of the earth's crust, or is it that her hip bones have been shaped  by a fault of engineering? Some coquetry cycles this blue edge, a spring ready to come forth to correct                                      love's mathematics. Saturday rises immaculately. The water's jade edge plays against corn-colored  picnic baskets, rose and lemon bottles, red balloons,  dancers in purple tights, a roan mare out of its field.  It is not the moment to think of Bahia and the gray mother with her water explanation.  Not far from here, the city, a mass of swift water  in its own depression, licks its sores. Still, I would be eased by reasons. Sand dunes in drifts. Lava cuts its own bed at a mountain base.  Blindness enters where the light refuses to go.  In Loch Lomond, the water flowers with algae  and a small life has taken the name of a star. You will hear my star-slow heart empty itself with a light-swift pitch  where the water thins to a silence. And the woman who will not be named  screams in the birth of her fading away.\n	'alga':205 'away':255 'bahia':143 'balloon':123 'base':189 'basket':117 'bed':185 'birth':251 'blind':190 'blue':90 'bone':77 'bottl':121 'bound':24 'central':4 'child':51 'citi':157 'color':115 'come':96 'coquetri':87 'corn':114 'corn-color':113 'correct':99 'crust':70 'cut':182 'cycl':88 'dancer':124 'day':29 'depress':166 'drift':180 'dune':178 'earth':68 'eas':174 'edg':91,110 'empti':225 'engin':85 'enter':191 'explan':151 'fade':254 'far':153 'fault':83 'field':134 'flower':203 'forth':97 'go':197 'gray':146 'green':19 'hear':219 'heard':57 'heart':224 'hip':26,76 'immacul':105 'jade':109 'lake':2 'land':22 'lava':181 'leav':44 'lemon':120 'lick':167 'life':209 'light':194,230 'light-swift':229 'loch':199 'lomond':200 'love':100 'lower':30 'mare':130 'mass':159 'mathemat':102 'moment':139 'mother':147 'mountain':188 'movement':65 'name':12,213,247 'park':5 'picnic':116 'pitch':232 'play':111 'purpl':126 'readi':94 'reason':176 'red':122 'refus':195 'ridg':37 'rise':104 'roan':129 'rose':118 'sack':48 'sand':177 'saturday':103 'scream':248 'sea':62 'shaken':45 'shape':80 'silenc':239 'sing':59 'skirt':20 'slow':64,223 'small':208 'someth':13 'sore':169 'sound':42 'spring':93 'star':216,222 'star-slow':221 'still':170 'swift':161,231 'taken':211 'tapestri':33 'tell':15 'thin':236 'think':141 'tight':127 'us':16 'vermilion':32 'voic':53 'water':39,107,150,162,202,235 'west':36 'woman':10,242 'would':172
849	Desire’s Persistence	312		\n1 In the region of rain and cloud, I live in shade, under the moss mat of days bruised                         purple with desire. My dominion is a song in the wide ring of water.  There, I run to and fro, braiding the logical act             in the birth of an Ear of Corn,  polychromatic story I will now tell in the weaving, power's form in motion, a devotion to the unstressed. Once, I wreathed around a king, became a fishing net, a maze                “a deadly wealth of robe.” Mothers who have heard me sing take heart;  I always prick them into power. 2 Y vengo alzando al viento la roja flor de invierno.

851	Song and Dance	307		\nDid you ever have a family?                                                        Dark  dining room,                   bright kitchen,                                         white steam from the big pot my mother’s stirring  reaching in wavy tendrils to her face,  around her face, all the way around  to me at the table, then beyond me  into the darkness where my brother is. Were you ever a child?                                              I’m hungry  but I know we’ll                          eat soon,                                                so even the hunger’s sweet. Did you ever really have a brother?                                                                   He’s singing  there in the dark                            corner                                      beside the stereo, the volume turned down so low  all we hear is him, his voice, and  his eyes are closed so that there’s  nothing around him anywhere that might reveal he isn’t who the song insists he is. And that is?                            Irresistible, unforgettable,                                    someone                                                      to whom  as in imaginary gardens where “the nectarine and curious peach into my hands themselves do reach,” love comes as soon as called, comes just as dreamed. Did any of this ever happen?                                                     The hunger’s sweet,           it’s as if                            the song weaves through the fragrance of the braiding  steam from him to me to her to me to him because her eyes are closed now too; her slippered feet tap, caper a soft shoe while the ladle sways in her hand as she stirs. Were you ever a child?                                              I know I’ll eat soon.                                   Did you ever really have a brother? You should have                                   heard him,                                                  his voice was  unforgettable, irresistible, his voice was an imaginary garden woven through with fragrance.

852	The Harp	313		\nWhen he was my age and I was already a boy  my father made a machine in the garage.  A wired piece of steel with many small and beautiful welds ground so smooth they resembled rows of pearls. He went broke with whatever it was.  He held it so carefully in his arms.  He carried it foundry to foundry.  I think it was his harp, I think it was what he longed to make  with his hands for the world. He moved it finally from the locked closet  to the bedroom to the garage again where he hung it on the wall until I climbed and pulled it down and rubbed it clean and tried to make it work.\n	'age':7 'alreadi':11 'arm':55 'beauti':31 'bedroom':93 'boy':13 'broke':43 'care':52 'carri':57 'clean':115 'climb':107 'closet':90 'father':15 'final':86 'foundri':59,61 'garag':21,96 'ground':33 'hand':79 'harp':2,67 'held':49 'hung':100 'lock':89 'long':74 'machin':18 'made':16 'make':76,119 'mani':28 'move':84 'pearl':40 'piec':24 'pull':109 'resembl':37 'row':38 'rub':113 'small':29 'smooth':35 'steel':26 'think':63,69 'tri':117 'wall':104 'weld':32 'went':42 'whatev':45 'wire':23 'work':121 'world':82
871	Love for a Hand	314		\nTwo hands lie still, the hairy and the white, \rAnd soon down ladders of reflected light \rThe sleepers climb in silence. Gradually \rThey separate on paths of long ago,\rEach winding on his arm the unpleasant clew \rThat leads, live as a nerve, to memory.\rBut often when too steep her dream descends, \rPerhaps to the grotto where her father bends \rTo pick her up, the husband wakes as though \rHe had forgotten something in the house. \rMotionless he eyes the room that glows \rWith the little animals of light that prowl\rThis way and that. Soft are the beasts of light \rBut softer still her hand that drifts so white \rUpon the whiteness. How like a water-plant \rIt floats upon the black canal of sleep, \rSuspended upward from the distant deep \rIn pure achievement of its lovely want!\rQuietly then he plucks it and it folds\rAnd is again a hand, small as a child’s.\rHe would revive it but it barely stirs\rAnd so he carries it off a little way\rAnd breaks it open gently. Now he can see \rThe sweetness of the fruit, his hand eats hers.\n	'achiev':141 'ago':33 'anim':92 'arm':38 'bare':170 'beast':104 'bend':65 'black':129 'break':182 'canal':130 'carri':175 'child':162 'clew':41 'climb':23 'deep':138 'descend':57 'distant':137 'dream':56 'drift':113 'eat':197 'eye':84 'father':64 'float':126 'fold':153 'forgotten':77 'fruit':194 'gentl':185 'glow':88 'gradual':26 'grotto':61 'hairi':10 'hand':4,6,111,158,196 'hous':81 'husband':71 'ladder':17 'lead':43 'lie':7 'light':20,94,106 'like':120 'littl':91,179 'live':44 'long':32 'love':1,144 'memori':49 'motionless':82 'nerv':47 'often':51 'open':184 'path':30 'perhap':58 'pick':67 'plant':124 'pluck':149 'prowl':96 'pure':140 'quiet':146 'reflect':19 'reviv':166 'room':86 'see':189 'separ':28 'silenc':25 'sleep':132 'sleeper':22 'small':159 'soft':101 'softer':108 'someth':78 'soon':15 'steep':54 'still':8,109 'stir':171 'suspend':133 'sweet':191 'though':74 'two':5 'unpleas':40 'upon':116,127 'upward':134 'wake':72 'want':145 'water':123 'water-pl':122 'way':98,180 'white':13,115,118 'wind':35 'would':165
872	Second Thoughts	315		\n. . . and then of course the weeping: some demurely, some \rflamboyantly. Those elegiac tears, if shed\renough, will alter a face and the person\rbehind the face. We all know that erosion\ris a mighty thing, and even—for example—\rthe seemingly permanent, hard-black Mississippi banks \rundo and slip south. In a sense, the delta\rat New Orleans—the land gone silt, and rebuilt—\ris the Mississippi’s second thought. “My pet, \ryour wiles have altered my earlier obstinacy,\rand the vision of you in your luxury stateroom beckons;\rI shall join you for your voyage on the Gigantic\r—what? oh. Titanic”—is a tragic second thought.\rA happy one: when Skyler and I decided to try again \rto “save the marriage.” Now we’re lazing in a pour \rof Sunday morning light as orangely voluptuous\ras marmalade. A simile’s a first thought,\rthen an equaled next. She slips back into sleep,\rand now I’m reading about the night that shady London dandy \rCharles Augustus Howell (1869) unshoveled the grave\rat Highgate, broke the coffin, and looted her bone breast\rof “the book in question, bound in rough gray calf, and with \rred edges to the leaves,” on eager orders from Rossetti \r—who’d had second thoughts in seven years, desiring\rto publish now a volume of his verses (1870, Poems). \rLizzie’s death-stenched pages were saturated\rwith disinfectant by a medical practitioner “who\ris drying them leaf by leaf”—and then they joined the world\rof woven radish baskets, bobbered fishing skeins, and god dolls \rin their second life as art on a museum wall; a world where \rthe “conversion pool” saw swimmers step in white robes\rfrom its farther end, reborn to new religion; and the lumbering\rland animals said no, and gave up legs, and so their legs rolled up \rlike stored-away and useless rugs inside them, and they returned \rto the waters, and birthed and breached in the waters,\rand made the waters their orchestral glory,\rand spouted out their great Ionic columns of air and water \rin the touch of the changing mind of Earth,\rthat’s sunlit at times\rand at other times darkened.\r\n	'1869':172 '1870':225 'air':348 'alter':20,79 'anim':298 'art':269 'augustus':170 'away':314 'back':154 'bank':49 'basket':257 'beckon':92 'behind':26 'birth':327 'black':47 'bobber':258 'bone':184 'book':188 'bound':191 'breach':329 'breast':185 'broke':178 'calf':195 'chang':356 'charl':169 'coffin':180 'column':346 'convers':278 'cours':6 'd':209 'dandi':168 'darken':369 'death':230 'death-stench':229 'decid':118 'delta':58 'demur':10 'desir':216 'disinfect':236 'doll':263 'dri':243 'eager':204 'earlier':81 'earth':359 'edg':199 'elegiac':14 'end':289 'enough':18 'equal':150 'eros':33 'even':39 'exampl':41 'face':22,28 'farther':288 'first':146 'fish':259 'flamboy':12 'gave':302 'gigant':102 'glori':339 'god':262 'gone':64 'grave':175 'gray':194 'great':344 'happi':112 'hard':46 'hard-black':45 'highgat':177 'howel':171 'insid':318 'ionic':345 'join':95,251 'know':31 'land':63,297 'laze':129 'leaf':245,247 'leav':202 'leg':304,308 'life':267 'light':136 'like':311 'lizzi':227 'london':167 'loot':182 'lumber':296 'luxuri':90 'm':160 'made':334 'marmalad':141 'marriag':125 'medic':239 'mighti':36 'mind':357 'mississippi':48,70 'morn':135 'museum':272 'new':60,292 'next':151 'night':164 'obstinaci':82 'oh':104 'one':113 'orang':138 'orchestr':338 'order':205 'orlean':61 'page':232 'perman':44 'person':25 'pet':75 'poem':226 'pool':279 'pour':132 'practition':240 'publish':218 'question':190 'radish':256 're':128 'read':161 'reborn':290 'rebuilt':67 'red':198 'religion':293 'return':322 'robe':285 'roll':309 'rossetti':207 'rough':193 'rug':317 'said':299 'satur':234 'save':123 'saw':280 'second':1,72,109,211,266 'seem':43 'sens':56 'seven':214 'shadi':166 'shall':94 'shed':17 'silt':65 'simil':143 'skein':260 'skyler':115 'sleep':156 'slip':52,153 'south':53 'spout':341 'stateroom':91 'stench':231 'step':282 'store':313 'stored-away':312 'sunday':134 'sunlit':362 'swimmer':281 'tear':15 'thing':37 'thought':2,73,110,147,212 'time':364,368 'titan':105 'touch':353 'tragic':108 'tri':120 'undo':50 'unshovel':173 'useless':316 'vers':224 'vision':85 'volum':221 'voluptu':139 'voyag':99 'wall':273 'water':325,332,336,350 'weep':8 'white':284 'wile':77 'world':253,275 'woven':255 'year':215
853	Love in the Weather’s Bells	312		\nSnow hurries the strawberries from the bush. Star-wet water rides  you into summer,  into my autumn. Your cactus hands  are at my heart again.  Lady, I court my dream of you in lilies and in rain.  I vest myself in your oldest memory  and in my oldest need.  And in my passion you are the deepest blue  of the oldest rose.  Star circle me an axe.  I cannot cut myself from any of your emblems.  It will soon be cold here, and dark here; the grass will lie flat to search for its spring head. I will bow again in the winter of your eyes. If there is music, it will be the weather's bells to call me to the abandoned chapel of your simple body.\n	'abandon':130 'autumn':24 'axe':74 'bell':6,124 'blue':65 'bodi':135 'bow':106 'bush':13 'cactus':26 'call':126 'cannot':76 'chapel':131 'circl':71 'cold':88 'court':35 'cut':77 'dark':91 'deepest':64 'dream':37 'emblem':83 'eye':113 'flat':97 'grass':94 'hand':27 'head':103 'heart':31 'hurri':8 'ladi':33 'lie':96 'lili':41 'love':1 'memori':51 'music':117 'need':56 'oldest':50,55,68 'passion':60 'rain':44 'ride':18 'rose':69 'search':99 'simpl':134 'snow':7 'soon':86 'spring':102 'star':15,70 'star-wet':14 'strawberri':10 'summer':21 'vest':46 'water':17 'weather':4,122 'wet':16 'winter':110
854	Killing Chickens	313		\nNever mind what you think. The old man did not rush Recklessly into the coop the last minute.  The chickens hardly stirred For the easy way he sang to them.  Red sun is burning out Past slag heaps of the mill. The old man  Touches the blade of his killing knife  With his fat thumb. I’m in the backyard on a quilt Spread out under the heavy dark plums  He cooks for his whiskey. He walks among the hens singing His chicken song way down in his throat  Until he finds the one who’s ready  And he holds her to his barrel chest. What did you think? Did you think you just jerk the bird  From her roost and hack her head off? Beyond the coop I see the fleeting white dress of my grandmother  As she crosses and recrosses the porch To fill the bucket with scalding water. How easy the feathers will come When she drowns them for plucking  And clouds the air with a stench I can’t stand not to breathe. I’m not even a boy yet but I watch  The old man sing out into the yard, His knife already at the chicken’s throat  When everything begins to spin in my world— He slices off the head without a squawk,  And swirls the bird in circles, a fine  Blood spray fanning out far enough  To reach me where I wait Obediently, where I can’t stop watching  The head the old man picks up, His free hand becomes a puppet chicken Clucking at me, pecking my head with the cold beak  Until I cry for him to stop, Until he pins me down, clucking, laughing, blood  All over his hands. He did it so I would remember him I tell myself all these years later. He did it because it was his last summer  Among us. In August he didn’t feel the fly  Come into his cancerous ear and lay its eggs. He didn’t feel the maggots hatch As he sat dazed with pills in the sun. He pecked my head and laughed out of love,  Out of love he snatched me roughly to his chest  And sang his foreign songs way, Way down in his throat.\n	'air':169 'alreadi':200 'among':80,316 'august':319 'backyard':62 'barrel':106 'beak':272 'becom':259 'begin':208 'beyond':128 'bird':119,225 'blade':49 'blood':230,287 'boy':185 'breath':179 'bucket':150 'burn':36 'cancer':329 'chest':107,369 'chicken':2,22,85,203,262 'circl':227 'cloud':167 'cluck':263,285 'cold':271 'come':159,326 'cook':74 'coop':17,130 'cri':275 'cross':142 'dark':71 'daze':345 'didn':321,336 'dress':136 'drown':162 'ear':330 'easi':27,155 'egg':334 'enough':235 'even':183 'everyth':207 'fan':232 'far':234 'fat':56 'feather':157 'feel':323,338 'fill':148 'find':94 'fine':229 'fleet':134 'fli':325 'foreign':373 'free':257 'grandmoth':139 'hack':124 'hand':258,291 'hard':23 'hatch':341 'head':126,218,250,268,354 'heap':40 'heavi':70 'hen':82 'hold':102 'jerk':117 'kill':1,52 'knife':53,199 'last':19,314 'later':306 'laugh':286,356 'lay':332 'love':359,362 'm':59,181 'maggot':340 'man':10,46,192,253 'mill':43 'mind':4 'minut':20 'never':3 'obedi':242 'old':9,45,191,252 'one':96 'past':38 'peck':266,352 'pick':254 'pill':347 'pin':282 'pluck':165 'plum':72 'porch':146 'puppet':261 'quilt':65 'reach':237 'readi':99 'reckless':14 'recross':144 'red':33 'rememb':298 'roost':122 'rough':366 'rush':13 'sang':30,371 'sat':344 'scald':152 'see':132 'sing':83,193 'slag':39 'slice':215 'snatch':364 'song':86,374 'spin':210 'spray':231 'spread':66 'squawk':221 'stand':176 'stench':172 'stir':24 'stop':247,279 'summer':315 'sun':34,350 'swirl':223 'tell':301 'think':7,111,114 'throat':91,205,380 'thumb':57 'touch':47 'us':317 'wait':241 'walk':79 'watch':189,248 'water':153 'way':28,87,375,376 'whiskey':77 'white':135 'without':219 'world':213 'would':297 'yard':197 'year':305 'yet':186
855	Boleros 14	312		\nNight enters the Plaza, step by step, in the singular  flaring of lamps on churro carts, taco stands,  benches set with deep bowls of pozole,  on rugs embroidered with relics, crosses, bones,                            pamphlets, dream books. Around this Cathedral, there is an order never shaken;  all our eyes and postures speak of the certainty                            of being forever in place. These are the ones who always hear the veiled day fall, the street tile's serpentine hiss under the evening's drone.  Compadre, not all have come from Reforma, along Madero.  There are those whose spotless white manta tells me  they are not from here—as now, you see, a village  wedding party come to engage the virgin's peace. This evening, in the Zócalo, lanterns become candles, or starlight, whatever recalls a woman, beating her clothes on rocks in a village stream. At her side, a man buckets the muddy water for his stove.  What does the spirit say, in its seating, when such impurity can console, and the slipped vowels of an unfamiliar name                                 rise from the shallows?  Lovers meet here, and carry consummation's black weed into dawn,  and meet again when the full moon,                   on its flamboyant feet, surges  over the mud floor of a barrio Saturday night.  She, of the rock, has offered the water man beans, flour tortillas, cebollas encurtidas and atole,  a hand for the bell dance that rings all night,  the surprise of knowing the name of the horse that waits in the shadows when the dance has gone. She knows this room, where every saint has danced,  revolves on its own foundation, and that the noon heat ache beneath her hair  guides her through a love's lost steps. Her love lies deeper than a heart's desire,  far beyond even her hand's intention, when midnight at the feast sings with the singular arrow that flies by day,                                   a sagitta mortis. Now, in her presence, I always return to hands,  parts of that “unwieldly flesh about our souls,” where the life of Fridays, the year of Lent, the wilderness,  lies and invites another danger. I sit at the mass, and mark the quail movement of the priests' hands,  as they draw submission from us. The long night of atonement that burrs our knees                                    feeds those hands. But there are other hands—our own, yet another's— in the mortar, in the glass,              tight with blood and innocence. A cathedral moment may last for centuries,  given to us as a day, and a day, and half a day,  as a baroque insistence lying over classic form, as the womb from which the nation rises whole.  Inside there, the nation walks the Chinese rail,  arrives at the Altar of Pardon,                                     lingers, goes on, to the grotto where the kings stand in holy elation.  Perhaps, this reticent man and woman will find  that moment of exhilaration in marriage, born on the mud floor when they entered each other  for the good hidden in each, in flesh that needs                                            no propitiation. There must be a “Canticle, a love-song, an Epithalamion, a marriage song of God, to our souls,  wrapped up, if we would open it, and read it.”              Adorar es dar para recibir. How much we have given to this Cathedral's life.  How often we have heard prophecies of famine,  or war, or pestilence, advocacies of labor  and fortune that have failed to sustain. Compadre, I wish I were clever enough to sleep  in a room of saints, and close my senses to the gaming, the burl of grilled meat and pulque,  the sweet talk of political murders, the corrido  laughter that follows a jefe to his bed, all these silences, all these intimations  of something still to be constructed. But forgive me for knowing this,                 that I have been touched by fire, and that, even in spiritual things, nothing is perfect.  And this I understand, in the Cathedral grotto, where the kings have buckled on  their customary deeds, the darkest lady has entered.

856	Song of Napalm	313		\nAfter the storm, after the rain stopped pounding,  We stood in the doorway watching horses  Walk off lazily across the pasture’s hill. We stared through the black screen, Our vision altered by the distance So I thought I saw a mist Kicked up around their hooves when they faded  Like cut-out horses Away from us. The grass was never more blue in that light, more  Scarlet; beyond the pasture Trees scraped their voices into the wind, branches  Crisscrossed the sky like barbed wire But you said they were only branches. Okay. The storm stopped pounding. I am trying to say this straight: for once  I was sane enough to pause and breathe  Outside my wild plans and after the hard rain  I turned my back on the old curses. I believed  They swung finally away from me ... But still the branches are wire And thunder is the pounding mortar,  Still I close my eyes and see the girl  Running from her village, napalm  Stuck to her dress like jelly, Her hands reaching for the no one  Who waits in waves of heat before her. So I can keep on living, So I can stay here beside you, I try to imagine she runs down the road and wings  Beat inside her until she rises  Above the stinking jungle and her pain Eases, and your pain, and mine. But the lie swings back again. The lie works only as long as it takes to speak  And the girl runs only as far As the napalm allows Until her burning tendons and crackling  Muscles draw her up into that final position Burning bodies so perfectly assume. Nothing  Can change that; she is burned behind my eyes  And not your good love and not the rain-swept air  And not the jungle green Pasture unfolding before us can deny it.\n	'across':22 'air':302 'allow':261 'alter':35 'around':48 'assum':280 'away':59,141 'back':131,238 'barb':88 'beat':215 'behind':288 'believ':137 'besid':202 'beyond':73 'black':31 'blue':67 'bodi':277 'branch':83,96,147 'breath':118 'burn':264,276,287 'chang':283 'close':158 'crackl':267 'crisscross':84 'curs':135 'cut':56 'cut-out':55 'deni':313 'distanc':38 'doorway':16 'draw':269 'dress':173 'eas':228 'enough':114 'eye':160,290 'fade':53 'far':257 'final':140,274 'girl':164,253 'good':294 'grass':63 'green':307 'hand':177 'hard':126 'heat':188 'hill':26 'hoov':50 'hors':18,58 'imagin':207 'insid':216 'jelli':175 'jungl':224,306 'keep':194 'kick':46 'lazili':21 'lie':236,241 'light':70 'like':54,87,174 'live':196 'long':245 'love':295 'mine':233 'mist':45 'mortar':155 'muscl':268 'napalm':3,169,260 'never':65 'noth':281 'okay':97 'old':134 'one':182 'outsid':119 'pain':227,231 'pastur':24,75,308 'paus':116 'perfect':279 'plan':122 'posit':275 'pound':11,101,154 'rain':9,127,300 'rain-swept':299 'reach':178 'rise':220 'road':212 'run':165,209,254 'said':92 'sane':113 'saw':43 'say':106 'scarlet':72 'scrape':77 'screen':32 'see':162 'sky':86 'song':1 'speak':250 'stare':28 'stay':200 'still':145,156 'stink':223 'stood':13 'stop':10,100 'storm':6,99 'straight':108 'stuck':170 'swept':301 'swing':237 'swung':139 'take':248 'tendon':265 'thought':41 'thunder':151 'tree':76 'tri':104,205 'turn':129 'unfold':309 'us':61,311 'villag':168 'vision':34 'voic':79 'wait':184 'walk':19 'watch':17 'wave':186 'wild':121 'wind':82 'wing':214 'wire':89,149 'work':242
857	Apparition of the Exile	313		\nThere was another life of cool summer mornings, the dogwood air and the slag stink so gray like our monsoon which we loved for the rain and cool wind until the rot came into us. And I remember the boys we were the evening of our departure, our mothers waving through the train’s black pluming exhaust; they were not proud in their tears of our leaving, so don’t tell me to shut up about the war or I might pull something from my head, from my head, from my head that you wouldn’t want to see and whoever the people are might be offended. From the green country you reconstruct in your brain, from the rubble and stink of your occupation, there is no moving out. A sweet boy who got drunk and brave on our long ride into the State draws a maze every day on white paper, precisely in his room of years as if you could walk into it. All day he draws and imagines his platoon will return from the burning river where he sent them sixteen years ago into fire. He can’t stop seeing the line of trees explode in white phosphorous blossoms and the liftship sent for them spinning uncontrollably beyond hope into the Citadel wall. Only his mother comes these days, drying the fruit in her apron or singing the cup of hot tea into his fingers which, like barbed wire, web the air.\n	'ago':190 'air':15,249 'anoth':7 'apparit':1 'apron':232 'barb':245 'beyond':215 'black':59 'blossom':206 'boy':44,136 'brain':120 'brave':141 'burn':182 'came':37 'citadel':219 'come':224 'cool':10,32 'could':166 'countri':115 'cup':236 'day':153,171,226 'departur':51 'dogwood':14 'draw':149,173 'dri':227 'drunk':139 'even':48 'everi':152 'exhaust':61 'exil':4 'explod':202 'finger':242 'fire':192 'fruit':229 'got':138 'gray':21 'green':114 'head':90,93,96 'hope':216 'hot':238 'imagin':175 'leav':71 'life':8 'liftship':209 'like':22,244 'line':199 'long':144 'love':27 'maze':151 'might':85,109 'monsoon':24 'morn':12 'mother':53,223 'move':132 'occup':128 'offend':111 'paper':156 'peopl':107 'phosphor':205 'platoon':177 'plume':60 'precis':157 'proud':65 'pull':86 'rain':30 'reconstruct':117 'rememb':42 'return':179 'ride':145 'river':183 'room':160 'rot':36 'rubbl':123 'see':103,197 'sent':186,210 'shut':78 'sing':234 'sixteen':188 'slag':18 'someth':87 'spin':213 'state':148 'stink':19,125 'stop':196 'summer':11 'sweet':135 'tea':239 'tear':68 'tell':75 'train':57 'tree':201 'uncontrol':214 'us':39 'walk':167 'wall':220 'want':101 'war':82 'wave':54 'web':247 'white':155,204 'whoever':105 'wind':33 'wire':246 'wouldn':99 'year':162,189
858	Her Life Runs Like a Red Silk Flag	313		\nBecause this evening Miss Hoang Yen sat down with me in the small tiled room of her family house I am unable to sleep. We shared a glass of cold and sweet water.   On a blue plate her mother brought us cake and smiled her betel-black teeth at me   but I did not feel strange in the house my country had tried to bomb into dust.   In English thick and dazed as blood she told me how she watched our planes   cross her childhood’s sky, all the children of Hanoi carried in darkness to mountain hamlets, Nixon’s   Christmas bombing. She let me hold her hand,   her shy unmoving fingers, and told me how afraid she was those days and how this fear   had dug inside her like a worm and lives   inside her still, won’t die or go away. And because she’s stronger, she comforted me,   said I’m not to blame, the million sorrows alive in her gaze. With the dead we share no common rooms. With the frightened we can’t think straight;   no words can bring the burning city back.   Outside on Hung Dao Street I tried to say good-bye and held her hand   too long so she looked back through traffic   towards her house and with her eyes   she told me I should leave. All night I ached for her and for myself   and nothing I could think or pray would make it stop. Some birds sang morning   home across the lake. In small reed boats   the lotus gatherers sailed out among their resuming white blossoms.                                            Hanoi, 1990\n	'1990':278 'ach':238 'across':260 'afraid':126 'aliv':170 'among':272 'away':152 'back':197,219 'betel':55 'betel-black':54 'bird':256 'black':56 'blame':166 'blood':83 'blossom':276 'blue':44 'boat':266 'bomb':74,111 'bring':193 'brought':48 'burn':195 'bye':209 'cake':50 'carri':102 'childhood':94 'children':99 'christma':110 'citi':196 'cold':38 'comfort':159 'common':180 'could':247 'countri':70 'cross':92 'dao':201 'dark':104 'day':130 'daze':81 'dead':176 'die':149 'dug':136 'dust':76 'english':78 'even':11 'eye':228 'famili':26 'fear':134 'feel':64 'finger':121 'flag':8 'frighten':184 'gather':269 'gaze':173 'glass':36 'go':151 'good':208 'good-by':207 'hamlet':107 'hand':117,213 'hanoi':101,277 'held':211 'hoang':13 'hold':115 'home':259 'hous':27,68,224 'hung':200 'insid':137,144 'lake':262 'leav':234 'let':113 'life':2 'like':4,139 'live':143 'long':215 'look':218 'lotus':268 'm':163 'make':252 'million':168 'miss':12 'morn':258 'mother':47 'mountain':106 'night':236 'nixon':108 'noth':245 'outsid':198 'plane':91 'plate':45 'pray':250 'red':6 'reed':265 'resum':274 'room':23,181 'run':3 'said':161 'sail':270 'sang':257 'sat':15 'say':206 'share':34,178 'shi':119 'silk':7 'sky':96 'sleep':32 'small':21,264 'smile':52 'sorrow':169 'still':146 'stop':254 'straight':189 'strang':65 'street':202 'stronger':157 'sweet':40 'teeth':57 'thick':79 'think':188,248 'tile':22 'told':85,123,230 'toward':222 'traffic':221 'tri':72,204 'unabl':30 'unmov':120 'us':49 'watch':89 'water':41 'white':275 'won':147 'word':191 'worm':141 'would':251 'yen':14
859	The Black Hose	313		\nA boy who knew enough to save for something  like the whim that took me downtown on the bus  one lost Saturday morning of my mother’s birthday,  I sat in the back where the gasoline smell  made me dizzy and I closed my eyes but didn’t  think of her, only of myself, basking in the light  and love that would fall down on me when I  handed her the box and she untied the bow to save and lifted something shining out and held it up before us  like a promise taking shape for once in her hands,  though I didn’t know what to buy, the bus door  hissing behind me because I’m in some kind of  state now, a trance that comes when you pull  at the cords of light that connect the mother to the boy,  the 1959 department store opening up before me like a jeweled city.  In lingerie I found myself surrounded by those torsos sheened in silk,  dreaming my mother, feeling the silk against me,  the two of us moving through a cloudy room  in a dance I can’t remember until shame comes.  From out of nowhere the matron frowned,  asked what I wanted, hovered over me. Confused and afraid I whispered, without thinking, The black hose with rhinestones down the seams please and pointed to the pair across the room  stretched over legs on the glass counter  as if about to step off and I saw her in my mind slip them on,  her skirt hiked above the garters, the sun  catching in her tangled hair until the matron made a sound in her throat  and looked at me with eyes that said  What’s wrong with you dirty boy. All the way home a sweet ache rocked me,  the silver package riding my lap like a heavy wrong thing I couldn’t give up no matter how it dragged me down to a place where I could barely breathe or see or feel.  Whatever happened that spinning afternoon— she ran her fingers over the rhinestone seams or she didn’t, she wore them out into an evening or kept them forever in her drawer of impossible things— doesn’t matter. I would find my way into the light of another woman into whose arms I fall nights my fingers can’t tear through the dark  that eats me, the silk stretched across her breasts,  the need for something womanly to raise me up  pounding in my head until I curl in sleep  away from those longings, ancient and blue.\n	'1959':147 'ach':301 'across':232,407 'afraid':213 'afternoon':343 'ancient':432 'anoth':385 'arm':389 'ask':204 'away':428 'back':36 'bare':333 'bask':58 'behind':116 'birthday':31 'black':2,219 'blue':434 'bow':80 'box':75 'boy':5,145,294 'breast':409 'breath':334 'bus':22,113 'buy':111 'catch':266 'citi':157 'close':46 'cloudi':185 'come':130,196 'confus':211 'connect':140 'cord':136 'could':332 'couldn':316 'counter':241 'curl':425 'danc':189 'dark':400 'depart':148 'didn':50,106,354 'dirti':293 'dizzi':43 'doesn':373 'door':114 'downtown':19 'drag':324 'drawer':369 'dream':170 'eat':402 'enough':8 'even':362 'eye':48,285 'fall':66,391 'feel':173,338 'find':378 'finger':347,394 'forev':366 'found':161 'frown':203 'garter':263 'gasolin':39 'give':318 'glass':240 'hair':270 'hand':72,103 'happen':340 'head':422 'heavi':312 'held':89 'hike':260 'hiss':115 'home':298 'hose':3,220 'hover':208 'imposs':371 'jewel':156 'kept':364 'kind':123 'knew':7 'know':108 'lap':309 'leg':237 'lift':84 'light':61,138,383 'like':13,94,154,310 'lingeri':159 'long':431 'look':281 'lost':24 'love':63 'm':120 'made':41,274 'matron':202,273 'matter':321,375 'mind':254 'morn':26 'mother':29,142,172 'move':182 'need':411 'night':392 'nowher':200 'one':23 'open':150 'packag':306 'pair':231 'place':329 'pleas':226 'point':228 'pound':419 'promis':96 'pull':133 'rais':416 'ran':345 'rememb':193 'rhineston':222,350 'ride':307 'rock':302 'room':186,234 'said':287 'sat':33 'saturday':25 'save':10,82 'saw':250 'seam':225,351 'see':336 'shame':195 'shape':98 'sheen':167 'shine':86 'silk':169,175,405 'silver':305 'skirt':259 'sleep':427 'slip':255 'smell':40 'someth':12,85,413 'sound':276 'spin':342 'state':125 'step':246 'store':149 'stretch':235,406 'sun':265 'surround':163 'sweet':300 'take':97 'tangl':269 'tear':397 'thing':314,372 'think':52,217 'though':104 'throat':279 'took':17 'torso':166 'tranc':128 'two':179 'unti':78 'us':93,181 'want':207 'way':297,380 'whatev':339 'whim':15 'whisper':215 'whose':388 'without':216 'woman':386,414 'wore':357 'would':65,377 'wrong':290,313

861	My Autumn Leaves	313		\nI watch the woods for deer as if I’m armed. I watch the woods for deer who never come.  I know the hes and shes in autumn rendezvous in orchards stained with fallen  apples’ scent.

874	Sestina: As There Are Support Groups, There Are Support Words	315		\nWhen visiting a distant (and imponderable) shire, \rone longs to hear the cry “Hygrometer!\rFresh hygrometer for sale!” Yes, and when the fair \rsex sidles close and coyly murmurs “nitrogen”\rinto a burly masculine ear, I guarantee you: the translation \ris very easy. The allurements of a local siren,\rwhispering the kind of patois a traveler like Lord Byron \rfavors, never fail to comfort, and to reassure,\revoking pleasant memories of one’s own beloved hygrometer \rat home, kept fresh in Cosmoline and camphor\rand awaiting one’s rearrival back in his native xenon and nitrogen. \rWithout these occasional reminiscences, any translation\rfrom nation to nation, tongue to tongue, becomes a translation \rdifficult to sustain. I think of my grandmother: “We're not hirin’ \rtoday” “Go away” “Dumb Jew”—her share\rof the language that greeted her here in the land of alien hygrometer \rand freedom, where she was only one more funny-skirted for-\reigner yearning to hear a lulling Hungarian nitrogen\rhum her to sleep. Eventually, of course, the American nitrogen \rsufficed. Her daughter could speak, in free translation,\rboth uranium and argon; and her granddaughter gigs with Fire ’n \rIce, a skinhead punk-grunge group that performs in sheer\rblack nighties and clown wigs—she plays mean electric hygrometer \rin the first set and then, for a twofer,\r(very American, that) plays paper-and-comb. Far\rout. She’s so fluent in various World Wide Webbery that nitrogen \rin a thousand different inflections is her birthright, and almost any translation, \rmind to mind, gender to gender, is second nature. “I earn\rmy keep, I party, I sleep” is her motto. Though she’s for-\rtunate in having a lover who’s CEO at Hygrometer,\rPotassium, Klein & Wong: it helps to pay the “hygrometer \rman” when he knocks at the door. I won’t say that they fear \rthis guy exactly, but he’s a major badass nitrogen-\rsucking cyberwired ninja-kicking shitheel (or, translation:\rcall him Sir). It makes one pine for a land where the birds all choir in \rsweetly trilling melodies on a flower-scented shore,\rand a translation sings all night. Row gen-\rtly toward it. The tender forests sigh, and the soft whirr \rof the hygrometer promises oxidation of iron.\r\n	'alien':153 'allur':55 'almost':264 'american':183,235 'argon':196 'await':96 'away':137 'back':100 'badass':332 'becom':120 'belov':85 'bird':354 'birthright':262 'black':215 'bur':43 'byron':69 'call':342 'camphor':94 'ceo':298 'choir':356 'close':36 'clown':218 'comb':241 'comfort':74 'cosmolin':92 'could':188 'cours':181 'coyli':38 'cri':23 'cyberwir':335 'daughter':187 'differ':258 'difficult':123 'distant':14 'door':316 'dumb':138 'ear':45 'earn':277 'easi':53 'eigner':167 'electr':223 'eventu':179 'evok':78 'exact':326 'fail':72 'fair':33 'far':242 'favor':70 'fear':323 'fire':202 'first':227 'flower':364 'flower-sc':363 'fluent':247 'forest':380 'free':191 'freedom':156 'fresh':25,90 'funni':164 'funny-skirt':163 'gen':374 'gender':270,272 'gig':200 'go':136 'granddaught':199 'grandmoth':130 'greet':146 'group':6,210 'grung':209 'guarante':47 'guy':325 'hear':21,170 'help':305 'hirin':134 'home':88 'hum':175 'hungarian':173 'hygromet':24,26,86,154,224,300,309,388 'ice':204 'imponder':16 'inflect':259 'iron':392 'jew':139 'keep':279 'kept':89 'kick':338 'kind':62 'klein':302 'knock':313 'land':151,351 'languag':144 'like':67 'local':58 'long':19 'lord':68 'lover':295 'lull':172 'major':331 'make':346 'man':310 'masculin':44 'mean':222 'melodi':360 'memori':80 'mind':267,269 'motto':286 'murmur':39 'n':203 'nation':114,116 'nativ':103 'natur':275 'never':71 'night':372 'nighti':216 'ninja':337 'ninja-kick':336 'nitrogen':40,106,174,184,254,333 'occasion':109 'one':18,82,97,161,347 'oxid':390 'paper':239 'paper-and-comb':238 'parti':281 'patoi':64 'pay':307 'perform':212 'pine':348 'play':221,237 'pleasant':79 'potassium':301 'promis':389 'punk':208 'punk-grung':207 're':132 'rearriv':99 'reassur':77 'reminisc':110 'row':373 'sale':28 'say':320 'scent':365 'second':274 'sestina':1 'set':228 'sex':34 'share':141 'sheer':214 'shire':17 'shitheel':339 'shore':366 'sidl':35 'sigh':381 'sing':370 'sir':344 'siren':59 'skinhead':206 'skirt':165 'sleep':178,283 'soft':384 'speak':189 'suck':334 'suffic':185 'support':5,9 'sustain':125 'sweet':358 'tender':379 'think':127 'though':287 'thousand':257 'tli':375 'today':135 'tongu':117,119 'toward':376 'translat':50,112,122,192,266,341,369 'travel':66 'trill':359 'tunat':291 'twofer':233 'uranium':194 'various':249 'visit':12 'webberi':252 'whirr':385 'whisper':60 'wide':251 'wig':219 'without':107 'won':318 'wong':303 'word':10 'world':250 'xenon':104 'yearn':168 'yes':29

864	Sentimental	315		\nThe light has traveled unthinkable thousands of miles to be   condensed, recharged, and poured off the white white pages of an open Bible the country parson holds in front of this couple   in a field, in July, in the sap and the flyswirl of July in upper Wisconsin, where their vows buzz in a ring in the air like the flies, and are as sweet as the sap, in these rich and ritual minutes.   Is it sentimental? Oops. And out of that Bible the light continues   to rush as if from a faucet. There will be a piecrust cooling   out of its own few x’ed-out cuts. And will it make us run   for the picklier taste of irony rolled around protectively on our tongues   like a grab of Greek olives? My students and I discuss this   slippery phenomenon. Does “context” matter? Does “earned” count? If a balled-up fidget of snakes in the underbrush dies in a freeze is it sentimental? No,   yes, maybe. What if a litter of cocker spaniels? What if we called them “puppydogs” in the same poem in that same hard,   hammering winter? When my father was buried, the gray snow in the cemetery was sheet tin. If I said that? Yes, no, what does “tone” or “history” do to the Hollywood hack violinists who patiently wait to play   the taut nerves of the closest human body until from that   lush cue alone, the eyes swell moistly, and the griefs we warehouse daily take advantage of this thinning of our systems, then the first sloppy gushes begin . . . Is that “wrong”? Did I tell you the breaths of the gravediggers puffed out like factorysmoke as they bent and straightened, bent and straightened, mechanically? Are wise old (toothless) Black blues singers   sentimental?—“gran’ma”? “country cookin’”? But they have their validity, don't they, yes? their sweat-in-the-creases, picking up the lighting in a fine-lined mesh of what it means to have gone through time   alive a little bit on this planet. Hands shoot up . . . opinions . . . questions . . . What if the sun wept? the moon? Why, in the face of those open faces, are we so squeamish? Call out the crippled girl and her only friend the up-for-sale foal,   and let her tootle her woeful pennywhistle musics.

In poverty of comfort I lay gunpowder plots. I lapse my insurance.\rI am the Babbitt metal of the future. I never read more than half of a book. But that half I read forever.\rI love the palimpsest, statues without heads, fertility dolls of the continent of Mu. I dream prehistory, the invention of dye. The palms of the dancers’ hands are vermillion. Their heads oscillate like the cobra. High-caste woman smelling of earth and silk, you can dry my feet with your hair.\rI take my place beside the Philistine and unfold my napkin. This afternoon I defend the Marines. I goggle at long cars.\rWithout compassion I attack the insane. Give them the horsewhip!\rThe homosexual lectures me brilliantly in the beer booth. I can feel my muscles soften. He smiles at my terror.\rPitchpots flicker in the lemon groves. I gaze down on the plains of Hollywood. My fine tan and my arrogance, my gray hair and my sneakers, O Israel!\rWherever I am I become. The power of entry is with me. In the doctor’s office a patient, calm and humiliated. In the foreign movies a native, shabby enough. In the art gallery a person of authority (there’s a secret way of approaching a picture. Others move off). The high official insults me to my face. I say nothing and accept the job. He offers me whiskey.\rHow beautifully I fake! I convince myself with men’s room jokes and epigrams. I paint myself into a corner and escape on pulleys of the unknown. Whatever I think at the moment is true. Turn me around in my tracks; I will take your side.\rFor the rest, I improvise and am not spiteful and water the plants on the cocktail table.\n	'accept':417 'achiev':122 'afternoon':287 'america':136 'anarchist':20 'approach':399 'argu':60 'around':461 'arrog':346 'art':387 'atheist':4,12 'attack':300 'audienc':157 'author':392 'babbitt':203 'backscuttl':40 'beauti':425 'becom':359 'beer':314 'besid':279 'book':216 'booth':315 'boredom':168 'brilliant':311 'bring':158 'brown':42 'calm':374 'car':296 'cast':260 'chief':93 'cobra':257 'cocktail':485 'comfort':191 'communiti':51 'compass':298 'contin':234 'contribut':39 'convinc':429 'corner':443 'coward':83 'dancer':248 'death':163 'defend':289 'desper':187 'despis':169 'deviat':35 'doctor':369 'doll':231 'dream':238 'dri':113,269 'drink':65 'dye':243 'earth':264 'electrocut':129 'enough':73,176,384 'entri':363 'epigram':437 'escap':445 'establish':89 'face':412 'fake':427 'father':43 'feel':318 'feet':271 'fertil':230 'fine':342 'flicker':328 'fondl':37 'forc':138 'foreign':379 'forev':222 'free':76 'free-load':75 'full':23 'futur':207 'galleri':388 'gaze':334 'give':303 'goggl':293 'good':175 'gray':348 'grove':332 'gunpowd':194 'hair':274,349 'half':213,219 'hand':249 'head':229,253 'high':48,259,406 'high-cast':258 'hollywood':340 'homosexu':308 'horsewhip':306 'humili':376 'imag':134 'improvis':474 'insan':302 'insult':408 'insur':199 'intellectu':88 'invent':241 'israel':354 'job':419 'joke':435 'kangaroo':119 'laps':197 'lay':193 'lectur':309 'lemon':331 'like':255 'load':77 'long':295 'love':224 'loyalti':30 'luck':140 'marin':291 'men':432 'metal':204 'modesti':63 'moment':456 'move':403 'movi':380 'mu':236 'muscl':320 'mystic':99 'name':53 'napkin':285 'nativ':382 'nerv':128 'never':71,209 'news':160 'noth':415 'o':353 'oath':31,104 'oblivion':147 'offer':421 'offic':371 'offici':78,407 'onan':124 'oscil':254 'other':402 'paint':439 'palimpsest':226 'palm':245 'pandanus':114 'patient':373 'peopl':59 'person':390 'philistin':281 'physic':82 'pictur':401 'pitchpot':327 'place':278 'plain':338 'plant':482 'plot':195 'poet':90 'pope':91 'poverti':189 'power':361 'prayer':8,16 'prehistori':239 'prematur':186 'professor':24 'psychic':123 'pulley':447 'rabbi':92 'race':152,183 'rat':120 'read':210,221 'reason':173 'rest':472 'room':434 'say':6,14,414 'scratch':117 'secret':396 'seen':108 'shabbi':383 'share':67 'side':469 'silk':266 'smell':262 'smile':323 'sneaker':352 'soften':321 'solemn':170 'spite':478 'staff':95 'stand':47 'statu':227 'success':155 'tabl':486 'take':28,85,102,276,467 'tan':343 'terror':326 'think':453 'three':45 'ticket':145 'track':464 'tree':126 'true':458 'turn':459 'unfold':283 'unknown':450 'unoffici':80 'uphold':132 'vermillion':251 'virgin':110 'water':480 'way':397 'whatev':451 'wherev':355 'whiskey':423 'without':228,297 'woman':261 'wreck':153 'write':142,165 'wrong':172
870	Imps	315		\nFire isn’t allowed, for the sake of the books.\rThe lean monk-copyist who scribes the books is slate-blue at his fingertips\rthis steely late-November day in the year 1000. Brother Ambrosio \rhuffs some perfunctory warmth on his stiffening hands, \rthen bends again to his goat’s-horn of ink. For every line, \rhe believes, he’s forgiven a sin. And now he’s at his heavy \runcial letters, and will be for nine hours more,\runtil a slab of bread and a beet relieve his transcriptual ardor. \rWhat he copies?—psalter, missal, hagiography:\rthe predetermined and sanctioned community passions \rof a religious culture. Nothing like the twentieth century’s \rprevalent kneejerk “self-expression.” Nothing like the priest,\rexcuse me: former priest, and former nun, on daytime talk TV, \rwho live, she tells us, in a “trinity of love” with the former \rcreator-of-tourist-ashtrays-out-of-catfish-heads. This is, \rshe insists, the final and jubilant stage of a lifelong “quest \rto feel belongingness” initiated thirty years before \rby parents skittering cross-country with the military: they were wholly rootless, and so she grew up “unable to commit.” The following day, \ra man confesses to pedophilia because of a lesbian aunt. \rA woman says she robbed the Sack-N-Save of $13.42 \r“because of what they’re dumping in the water supply, it makes me \rgo all freaky.” Steve was bounced out from The Chicken Shack \r“because I’m Scandinavian.” The culture\rof blame is so completely exterior in its search for cause, \rsome days I wake to think I’ll find most people laboring\runder the weight of sci-fi-style mind parasites, like fleshy turbans \rspewing in, and feeding off, their brain blood. This (by “this”\rI mean of course a recognition of the magic of objective correlative \rboppin’ about in the spotlight) is, to some length, \runderstandable: you can’t beat the miniscule carry-along \rconvenience of a silicon chip invisibly set in something, \rBUT for sheer persuasive visual power, that can’t touch \ra 1940s generating plant, its giant Alcatrazian shape \ragainst the sky, and the enormous wrestling electrical crackles \rsnaking its rooftop pylon. In the scriptorium, even\r—such an isolated unit of human endeavor, its limited range \rof reactions surely is pure—when Brother Ambrosio \rnods off, sleepy in his long day’s long eighth hour \rof thickly nibbed and careful letters, he knows\rit’s imps in league with Satan that keep pulling down his eyelids. \rIf in scratching his flea-measled thigh he spills \ra hand’s-expanse of ink across the vellum page, the fleas \rare tiny devils on a guerilla mission from Hell. \rAnd once a devilkin took lodging in his belly, and there \rcreated “rumbling noises like a toad, and which, for hours, \rspoiled the concentration of all of the other Brothers.” \rWe find parchment scraps with appropriate exorcisms:\r“Away! you flaming sow, you poisoned udder,\ryou arse of the arch-fiend, shit-fly, stinking he-goat, \rout out out, away, back into thine infernal kitchen,\ryou bestial puke!” We also find\rthose charming marginal doodles (sprigs in flower, \runicorns, seemingly every songbird in Creation): such \rdiminutive external bodies given to the longings of these \rcooped-up men. And when they came to drag my friend Jess \rscreaming to the ward, because he was beating his head \ron the lawyer’s steps, it was clear to us all that the chemicals \rin his mind had turned against him. It was clear to Jess\rthat he was being hunted like prey by hounds from the moon.\r\n	'1000':37 '13.42':226 '1940s':355 'across':446 'alcatrazian':360 'allow':5 'along':334 'also':532 'ambrosio':39,396 'appropri':496 'arch':510 'arch-fiend':509 'ardor':96 'ars':506 'ashtray':156 'aunt':214 'away':498,522 'back':523 'beat':329,577 'beet':92 'believ':63 'belli':469 'belonging':176 'bend':49 'bestial':529 'blame':258 'blood':300 'blue':24 'bodi':550 'book':11,20 'boppin':316 'bounc':245 'brain':299 'bread':89 'brother':38,395,490 'came':564 'care':412 'carri':333 'carry-along':332 'catfish':159 'caus':267 'centuri':117 'charm':535 'chemic':593 'chicken':249 'chip':339 'clear':587,603 'commit':201 'communiti':107 'complet':261 'concentr':484 'confess':207 'conveni':335 'coop':558 'cooped-up':557 'copi':99 'copyist':16 'correl':315 'countri':186 'cours':307 'crackl':370 'creat':472 'creation':546 'creator':153 'creator-of-tourist-ashtrays-out-of-catfish-head':152 'cross':185 'cross-countri':184 'cultur':112,256 'day':33,204,269,403 'daytim':136 'devil':454 'devilkin':464 'diminut':548 'doodl':537 'drag':566 'dump':232 'eighth':406 'electr':369 'endeavor':385 'enorm':367 'even':378 'everi':60,543 'excus':128 'exorc':497 'expans':443 'express':123 'exterior':262 'extern':549 'eyelid':428 'feed':296 'feel':175 'fi':286 'fiend':511 'final':166 'find':276,492,533 'fingertip':27 'fire':2 'flame':500 'flea':434,451 'flea-measl':433 'fleshi':291 'fli':514 'flower':540 'follow':203 'forgiven':66 'former':130,133,151 'freaki':242 'friend':568 'generat':356 'giant':359 'given':551 'go':240 'goat':53,518 'grew':197 'guerilla':457 'hagiographi':102 'hand':47,440 'he-goat':516 'head':160,579 'heavi':75 'hell':460 'horn':56 'hound':614 'hour':83,407,481 'huff':40 'human':384 'hunt':610 'imp':1,418 'infern':526 'initi':177 'ink':58,445 'insist':164 'invis':340 'isn':3 'isol':381 'jess':569,605 'jubil':168 'keep':424 'kitchen':527 'kneejerk':120 'know':415 'labor':279 'late':31 'late-novemb':30 'lawyer':582 'leagu':420 'lean':13 'length':324 'lesbian':213 'letter':77,413 'lifelong':172 'like':114,125,290,475,611 'limit':387 'line':61 'live':140 'll':275 'lodg':466 'long':402,405,554 'love':148 'm':253 'magic':312 'make':238 'man':206 'margin':536 'mean':305 'measl':435 'men':560 'militari':189 'mind':288,596 'miniscul':331 'missal':101 'mission':458 'monk':15 'monk-copyist':14 'moon':617 'n':223 'nib':410 'nine':82 'nod':397 'nois':474 'noth':113,124 'novemb':32 'nun':134 'object':314 'page':449 'parasit':289 'parchment':493 'parent':182 'passion':108 'pedophilia':209 'peopl':278 'perfunctori':42 'persuas':347 'plant':357 'poison':503 'power':349 'predetermin':104 'preval':119 'prey':612 'priest':127,131 'psalter':100 'puke':530 'pull':425 'pure':393 'pylon':374 'quest':173 'rang':388 're':231 'reaction':390 'recognit':309 'reliev':93 'religi':111 'rob':219 'rooftop':373 'rootless':193 'rumbl':473 's-expans':441 's-horn':54 'sack':222 'sack-n-sav':221 'sake':8 'sanction':106 'satan':422 'save':224 'say':217 'scandinavian':254 'sci':285 'sci-fi-styl':284 'scrap':494 'scratch':431 'scream':570 'scribe':18 'scriptorium':377 'search':265 'seem':542 'self':122 'self-express':121 'set':341 'shack':250 'shape':361 'sheer':346 'shit':513 'shit-fli':512 'silicon':338 'sin':68 'skitter':183 'sky':364 'slab':87 'slate':23 'slate-blu':22 'sleepi':399 'snake':371 'someth':343 'songbird':544 'sow':501 'spew':293 'spill':438 'spoil':482 'spotlight':320 'sprig':538 'stage':169 'steeli':29 'step':584 'steve':243 'stiffen':46 'stink':515 'style':287 'suppli':236 'sure':391 'talk':137 'tell':142 'thick':409 'thigh':436 'thine':525 'think':273 'thirti':178 'tini':453 'toad':477 'took':465 'touch':353 'tourist':155 'transcriptu':95 'triniti':146 'turban':292 'turn':598 'tv':138 'twentieth':116 'udder':504 'unabl':199 'uncial':76 'understand':325 'unicorn':541 'unit':382 'us':143,589 'vellum':448 'visual':348 'wake':271 'ward':573 'warmth':43 'water':235 'weight':282 'wholli':192 'woman':216 'wrestl':368 'year':36,179

This isn’t why they were sent to the madhouse: this is what \rthey needed to do once in the madhouse: this \ris the only meaningful ritual they could fashion \rthere, created from the few, make-do \rmaterials available. It isn’t wondrous strange \rmore than the mega-boozhwah formulaic splendor \rof my sister’s wedding ten, eleven years ago: \rher opulent bouquet of plastic flowers \r(for the wilting pour of wattage at the photo session), \rnigglingly arranged to match the real bouquet \rshe carried down the aisle, bloom per bloom; \rthe five-foot Taj Mahal of sculpted pastel sherbet; \rendless “Fiddler on the Roof”; I’m sorry \rnow I cranked my academic sneer hauteur in place \rall night.

877	Traveling through the Dark	316		\nTraveling through the dark I found a deer dead on the edge of the Wilson River road. It is usually best to roll them into the canyon: that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead. By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car   and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;   she had stiffened already, almost cold. I dragged her off; she was large in the belly. My fingers touching her side brought me the reason— her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,   alive, still, never to be born. Beside that mountain road I hesitated. The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;   under the hood purred the steady engine. I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;   around our group I could hear the wilderness listen. I thought hard for us all—my only swerving—,   then pushed her over the edge into the river.\n	'ahead':114 'aim':113 'aliv':99 'almost':69 'alreadi':68 'around':137 'back':51 'belli':80 'besid':105 'best':25 'born':104 'brought':86 'canyon':31 'car':54,112 'cold':70 'could':141 'dark':4,8 'dead':13,41 'deer':12 'doe':61 'drag':72 'edg':16,160 'engin':125 'exhaust':134 'fawn':95 'finger':82 'found':10 'glare':130 'glow':43 'group':139 'hard':148 'heap':59 'hear':142 'hesit':110 'hood':121 'kill':64 'larg':77 'lay':96 'light':48,118 'listen':145 'lower':116 'make':39 'might':38 'mountain':107 'narrow':35 'never':101 'park':117 'pur':122 'push':156 'reason':89 'recent':63 'red':136 'river':20,163 'road':21,33,108 'roll':27 'side':85,91 'steadi':124 'stiffen':67 'still':100 'stood':56,127 'stumbl':50 'swerv':37,154 'tail':47 'tail-light':46 'thought':147 'touch':83 'travel':1,5 'turn':135 'us':150 'usual':24 'wait':98 'warm':93,133 'wilder':144 'wilson':19
878	D____ L____’s	315		\nThere might be a planet. Before that, though, there would have been a gas that coalesced  into a planet . . . as, before that, there were dots of flux  and energy that hadn’t yet declared themselves in concert. There’s always “before”: there's more each minute, more each person, yes and every one of its smallest, irreducible subparticles—which I name  the “beforeon”—is exerting force on us that’s surely time’s own version of gravity: its purpose is to tug, and to remind us. In the house of second marriages, it causes the man to do what he and the woman had promised  they never would: one night while she’s asleep, he snoops  her bureau for telltale relics of the mysterious Mr.  Number One. And why, or even what he hopes to find, he couldn’t clearly say: a letter? photo?  sex toy?—something, some objectified gossip, a fossil  of bygone love. Essentially, we make of our own psyches  a bureau and pay a shrink to snoop; as for the moment  when our neural linkage first began to form, as for the flavor of the fluids in the womb. . . we’re all amnesiacs: and our earliest self, just like the universe’s  earliest being, is a “phantom limb” with the faintest  mnemonic of starbursts in an otherwise chill void. I have  a friend D____ L____ (this poem is hers) who, orphaned  as a newborn, is devoted to learning her origin as doggedly as any cosmologist tracks light to its source, although  her search (when not pure Internet) is more a matter of tape-recording the beer-sour stories in sailor bars, of sifting ashy memories in nursing homes, one backwards inch of plotline at a time. And yet somebody else is waking up this morning with the need  to be detached from any history, to stand here like a person in a play who enters  onstage from a pool of perfect blankness. Then, of course, he can start over, minute-zero-of-year-zero,  unbesmirched. We could have told him that he’d be this  anguished—sneaking in her drawer, below those folded  pastel lozenges of lingerie, uncovering the one thing  that could ruin them. Now he wants only to float (who  doesn't, sometimes?) in an anti-world: appealing, but illusory. We can’t unmoor ourselves from linearity,  no more than any one of us can be a human being  unconnected to a genome—and in fact, no more  than Mama-All-of-Time-and-Space-Herself (I mean  the cosmos) can unwrap her vasty body from its own  twelve million years of Big Bang “background radiation”  so it wafts—a tossed off, filmy scarf—far elsewhere.  No; there isn’t any “elsewhere.” When we sleep  or simply deepen into quietude enough, the voices  come—the rhythmic, grave, ancestral murmur, a woman bearing a ritual clamshell bowl . . . a man with a done-deal sales contract . . . whispers, knuckle-rap, cleared throats. . . . Her great-grandfather,  D____ L____ has uncovered, was a lector—a reader they used  to relieve the tedium of the leaf rollers’ shifts  in cigar manufactories. Shakespeare, Dickens,  union tracts, love letters, family diaries . . . . He’s  walking through the tobacco aroma; he’s setting his text  on his easel; and the story—the only story we know,  the story of Before—is recited. \n	'although':257 'alway':43 'amnesiac':199 'ancestr':481 'anguish':355 'anti':388 'anti-world':387 'appeal':390 'aroma':546 'ashi':282 'asleep':117 'background':448 'backward':288 'bang':447 'bar':279 'bear':485 'beer':274 'beer-sour':273 'beforeon':66 'began':183 'big':446 'blank':330 'bodi':438 'bowl':489 'bureau':121,167 'bygon':157 'caus':97 'chill':224 'cigar':530 'clamshel':488 'clear':143,503 'coalesc':19 'come':477 'concert':40 'contract':498 'cosmologist':251 'cosmos':433 'could':346,372 'couldn':141 'cours':333 'd':1,230,352,509 'deal':496 'declar':37 'deepen':471 'detach':309 'devot':242 'diari':539 'dicken':533 'doesn':382 'dog':248 'done':495 'done-d':494 'dot':28 'drawer':359 'earliest':202,209 'easel':554 'els':298 'elsewher':459,465 'energi':32 'enough':474 'enter':323 'essenti':159 'even':134 'everi':55 'exert':68 'fact':418 'faintest':217 'famili':538 'far':458 'filmi':456 'find':139 'first':182 'flavor':189 'float':380 'fluid':192 'flux':30 'fold':362 'forc':69 'form':185 'fossil':155 'friend':229 'gas':17 'genom':415 'gossip':153 'grandfath':508 'grave':480 'graviti':80 'great':507 'great-grandfath':506 'hadn':34 'histori':312 'home':286 'hope':137 'hous':92 'human':410 'illusori':392 'inch':289 'internet':263 'irreduc':60 'isn':462 'know':562 'knuckl':501 'knuckle-rap':500 'l':2,231,510 'leaf':526 'learn':244 'lector':515 'letter':146,537 'light':253 'like':205,316 'limb':214 'linear':399 'lingeri':366 'linkag':181 'love':158,536 'lozeng':364 'make':161 'mama':423 'mama-all-of-time-and-space-herself':422 'man':99,491 'manufactori':531 'marriag':95 'matter':267 'mean':431 'memori':283 'might':5 'million':443 'minut':49,339 'minute-zero-of-year-zero':338 'mnemon':218 'moment':177 'morn':303 'mr':128 'murmur':482 'mysteri':127 'name':64 'need':306 'neural':180 'never':110 'newborn':240 'night':113 'number':129 'nurs':285 'objectifi':152 'one':56,112,130,287,369,404 'onstag':324 'origin':246 'orphan':237 'otherwis':223 'pastel':363 'pay':169 'perfect':329 'person':52,318 'phantom':213 'photo':147 'planet':8,22 'play':321 'plotlin':291 'poem':233 'pool':327 'promis':108 'psych':165 'pure':262 'purpos':82 'quietud':473 'radiat':449 'rap':502 're':197 'reader':517 'recit':568 'record':271 'relic':124 'reliev':521 'remind':88 'rhythmic':479 'ritual':487 'roller':527 'ruin':373 'sailor':278 'sale':497 'say':144 'scarf':457 'search':259 'second':94 'self':203 'set':549 'sex':148 'shakespear':532 'shift':528 'shrink':171 'sift':281 'simpli':470 'sleep':468 'smallest':59 'sneak':356 'snoop':119,173 'somebodi':297 'someth':150 'sometim':384 'sour':275 'sourc':256 'space':428 'stand':314 'starburst':220 'start':336 'stori':276,557,560,564 'subparticl':61 'sure':74 'tape':270 'tape-record':269 'tedium':523 'telltal':123 'text':551 'thing':370 'though':11 'throat':504 'time':75,294,426 'tobacco':545 'told':348 'toss':454 'toy':149 'track':252 'tract':535 'tug':85 'twelv':442 'unbesmirch':344 'unconnect':412 'uncov':367,512 'union':534 'univers':207 'unmoor':396 'unwrap':435 'us':71,89,406 'use':519 'vasti':437 'version':78 'voic':476 'void':225 'waft':452 'wake':300 'walk':542 'want':377 'whisper':499 'woman':106,484 'womb':195 'world':389 'would':13,111 'year':342,444 'yes':53 'yet':36,296 'zero':340,343

It was looking at something farther off   than people could see, an important scene   acted in stone for little selves at the flute end of consequences.

880	Laws of the Universe	315		\nThe renewal project is doomed: because its funding board’s vice-president resigned: because  the acids of divorce were eating day-long  at her stomach, at her thoughts: because her husband was neglecting her, in favor of his daughter, who was dying: because her husband, bi and edgy, bore an AIDS sore that was ripe  enough with fear and woe to throw this whole  thick network of connections off its balance and down a hole of human misery. Haven’t we seen it happen?  —when a crowded room at a party was tilted  perilously askew by the weight of two  wept tears that weren’t as large as a housefly’s wings,  that couldn’t have filled a pistachio shell. _________ It’s like this: because because because, Sawyer was drunk when he delivered his opening remarks  onstage at Stardome Planetarium. He stood below a slide show of “The Emptiness of Outer Space”  —stars and planets, scattered like the scantest motes of dust in unimaginable void—and was about  to make the leap to what percent of us, our dearly thumping bodies, is a corresponding emptiness . . .  when one foot met a wire that had strayed outside the curtain, and a wild arc of hand undid the podium, which canted off its casters sidelong into the 3-D galaxy props, and you could say whatever  thimble or pustule or hackle of grief was his, it had toppled the whole damn universe. _________ Was she a ghost? Sometimes she thought she was a ghost, transparent, stealing through the lives of people  untouched and untouching. And so she carried a bucket  of burning coals (we’ll call it that for now) against  her breasts; and then she knew she was alive. And  he. . . ?—was just the rusty foxing that an antique book  exhales into dim air, wasn’t that what he was,  oh it was, yes it was, and so one afternoon he strapped  a meteorite to his back, and now he walks the streets  like anybody else.

A wildcat sprang at Grandpa on the Fourth of July   when he was cutting plum bushes for fuel, before Indians pulled the West over the edge of the sky. To anyone who looked at us we said, “My friend”;   liking the cut of a thought, we could say “Hello.” (But plain black hats rode the thoughts that made our code.)

886	Report to Crazy Horse	316		\nAll the Sioux were defeated. Our clan   got poor, but a few got richer. They fought two wars. I did not take part. No one remembers your vision   or even your real name. Now   the children go to town and like   loud music. I married a Christian. Crazy Horse, it is not fair to hide a new vision from you. In our schools we are learning to take aim when we talk, and we have   found out our enemies. They shift when   words do; they even change and hide   in every person. A teacher here says   hurt or scorned people are places   where real enemies hide. He says   we should not hurt or scorn anyone,   but help them. And I will tell you   in a brave way, the way Crazy Horse   talked: that teacher is right. I will tell you a strange thing: at the rodeo, close to the grandstand,   I saw a farm lady scared by a blown   piece of paper; and at that place   horses and policemen were no longer   frightening, but suffering faces were,   and the hunched-over backs of the old. Crazy Horse, tell me if I am right: these are the things we thought we were   doing something about. In your life you saw many strange things,   and I will tell you another: now I salute   the white man’s flag. But when I salute   I hold my hand alertly on the heartbeat   and remember all of us and how we depend   on a steady pulse together. There are those   who salute because they fear other flags   or mean to use ours to chase them:   I must not allow my part of saluting   to mean this. All of our promises,   our generous sayings to each other, our   honorable intentions—those I affirm   when I salute. At these times it is like   shutting my eyes and joining a religious colony at prayer in the gray dawn   in the deep aisles of a church. Now I have told you about new times.   Yes, I know others will report different things. They have been caught   by weak ways.

One place   I loosen a rock and listen a long time till it hits, faint in the gulf, but the rush of the torrent almost drowns it out, and the wind— I almost forgot the wind: it tears at your side   or it waits and then buffets; you sag outward. . . . I remember they said it would be hard. I scramble   by luck into a little pocket out of the wind and begin to beat on the stones with my scratched numb hands, rocking back and forth in silent laughter there in the dark— “Made it again!” Oh how I love this climb! —the whispering to stones, the drag, the weight   as your muscles crack and ease on, working   right. They are back there, discontent, waiting to be driven forth. I pound on the earth, riding the earth past the stars:   “Made it again!

At her job in the library she arranged better and better flowers, and when   students asked for books her hand went out   to help. In the last year of her life she had to keep her friends from knowing   how happy they were. She listened while they complained about food or work or the weather.   And the great national events danced   their grotesque, fake importance. Always Pain moved where she moved. She walked   ahead; it came. She hid; it found her.   No one ever served another so truly;   no enemy ever meant so strong a hate.   It was almost as if there was no room   left for her on earth. But she remembered where joy used to live. She straightened its flowers;   she did not weep when she passed its houses;   and when finally she pulled into a tiny corner   and slipped from pain, her hand opened again, and the streets opened, and she wished all well.\n	'ahead':95 'almost':120 'alway':87 'anoth':107 'arrang':29 'ask':37 'bess':1,7 'better':30,32 'book':39 'came':97 'cancer':11 'complain':69 'corner':161 'danc':82 'day':17 'earth':131 'enemi':111 'event':81 'ever':105,112 'everi':16 'fake':85 'final':155 'first':8 'flower':33,143 'food':71 'found':101 'friend':58 'great':79 'grotesqu':84 'hand':41,167 'happi':62 'hate':117 'help':45 'hid':99 'hous':21,152 'import':86 'job':24 'joy':136 'keep':56 'know':60 'last':48 'left':127 'librari':27 'life':52 'listen':66 'live':139 'meant':113 'met':9 'move':89,92 'nation':80 'one':104 'open':168,173 'pain':88,165 'pass':150 'past':18 'pull':157 'rememb':134 'room':126 'secur':20 'serv':106 'slip':163 'straighten':141 'street':5,172 'strong':115 'student':36 'tini':160 'truli':109 'use':137 'walk':94 'weather':76 'weep':147 'well':178 'went':13,42 'wish':176 'work':15,73 'year':49

Hibernating in the library of the school on the hill   a few pieces by Thomas Aquinas or Saint Teresa and the fragmentary explorations of people like Alfred   North Whitehead crouch and wait amid research folders   on energy and military recruitment posters glimpsed   by the hard stars.

890	Humanities Lecture	316		\nAristotle was a little man with eyes like a lizard, and he found a streak down the midst of things, a smooth place for his feet  much more important than the carved handles  on the coffins of the great. He said you should put your hand out  at the time and place of need: strength matters little, he said, nor even speed. His pupil, a king's son, died at an early age. That Aristotle spoke of him  it is impossible to find—the youth was  notorious, a conqueror, a kid with a gang,  but even this Aristotle didn't ever say. Around the farthest forest and along  all the bed of the sea, Aristotle studied  immediate, local ways. Many of which  were wrong. So he studied poetry.  There, in pity and fear, he found Man. Many thinkers today, who stand low and grin,  have little use for anger or power, its palace  or its prison— but quite a bit for that little man with eyes like a lizard.\n	'age':75 'along':110 'anger':151 'aristotl':3,77,100,117 'around':105 'bed':113 'bit':162 'carv':34 'coffin':38 'conqueror':91 'didn':101 'die':71 'earli':74 'even':63,98 'ever':103 'eye':9,168 'farthest':107 'fear':135 'feet':28 'find':85 'forest':108 'found':15,137 'gang':96 'great':41 'grin':146 'hand':48 'handl':35 'human':1 'immedi':119 'import':31 'imposs':83 'kid':93 'king':68 'lectur':2 'like':10,169 'littl':6,59,148,165 'lizard':12,171 'local':120 'low':144 'man':7,138,166 'mani':122,139 'matter':58 'midst':20 'much':29 'need':56 'notori':89 'palac':155 'piti':133 'place':25,54 'poetri':130 'power':153 'prison':158 'pupil':66 'put':46 'quit':160 'said':43,61 'say':104 'sea':116 'smooth':24 'son':70 'speed':64 'spoke':78 'stand':143 'streak':17 'strength':57 'studi':118,129 'thing':22 'thinker':140 'time':52 'today':141 'use':149 'way':121 'wrong':126 'youth':87
891	April Inventory	317		\nThe green catalpa tree has turned All white; the cherry blooms once more.   In one whole year I haven’t learned   A blessed thing they pay you for.   The blossoms snow down in my hair;   The trees and I will soon be bare. The trees have more than I to spare.   The sleek, expensive girls I teach,   Younger and pinker every year,   Bloom gradually out of reach. The pear tree lets its petals drop   Like dandruff on a tabletop. The girls have grown so young by now   I have to nudge myself to stare. This year they smile and mind me how   My teeth are falling with my hair.   In thirty years I may not get Younger, shrewder, or out of debt. The tenth time, just a year ago,   I made myself a little list Of all the things I’d ought to know,   Then told my parents, analyst,   And everyone who’s trusted me   I’d be substantial, presently. I haven’t read one book about A book or memorized one plot.   Or found a mind I did not doubt. I learned one date. And then forgot.   And one by one the solid scholars   Get the degrees, the jobs, the dollars. And smile above their starchy collars. I taught my classes Whitehead’s notions;   One lovely girl, a song of Mahler’s.   Lacking a source-book or promotions,   I showed one child the colors of   A luna moth and how to love. I taught myself to name my name, To bark back, loosen love and crying;   To ease my woman so she came,   To ease an old man who was dying.   I have not learned how often I Can win, can love, but choose to die. I have not learned there is a lie Love shall be blonder, slimmer, younger;   That my equivocating eye Loves only by my body’s hunger; That I have forces, true to feel, Or that the lovely world is real. While scholars speak authority And wear their ulcers on their sleeves,   My eyes in spectacles shall see These trees procure and spend their leaves.   There is a value underneath The gold and silver in my teeth. Though trees turn bare and girls turn wives,   We shall afford our costly seasons; There is a gentleness survives That will outspeak and has its reasons.   There is a loveliness exists, Preserves us, not for specialists.\n	'afford':376 'ago':131 'analyst':151 'april':1 'author':333 'back':256 'bare':45,369 'bark':255 'bless':25 'blonder':302 'bloom':13,65 'blossom':32 'bodi':313 'book':168,171,230 'came':267 'catalpa':5 'cherri':12 'child':236 'choos':288 'class':214 'collar':210 'color':238 'cost':378 'cri':260 'd':143,159 'dandruff':78 'date':187 'debt':124 'degre':200 'die':275,290 'dollar':204 'doubt':183 'drop':76 'eas':262,269 'equivoc':307 'everi':63 'everyon':153 'exist':396 'expens':56 'eye':308,342 'fall':108 'feel':322 'forc':319 'forgot':190 'found':177 'gentl':383 'get':118,198 'girl':57,83,220,371 'gold':360 'gradual':66 'green':4 'grown':85 'hair':37,111 'haven':21,164 'hunger':315 'inventori':2 'job':202 'know':146 'lack':226 'learn':23,185,279,294 'leav':353 'let':73 'lie':298 'like':77 'list':137 'littl':136 'loosen':257 'love':219,246,258,286,299,309,326 'loveli':395 'luna':241 'made':133 'mahler':224 'man':272 'may':116 'memor':173 'mind':102,179 'moth':242 'name':251,253 'notion':217 'nudg':93 'often':281 'old':271 'one':17,167,174,186,192,194,218,235 'ought':144 'outspeak':387 'parent':150 'pay':28 'pear':71 'petal':75 'pinker':62 'plot':175 'present':162 'preserv':397 'procur':349 'promot':232 'reach':69 'read':166 'real':329 'reason':391 'scholar':197,331 'season':379 'see':346 'shall':300,345,375 'show':234 'shrewder':120 'silver':362 'sleek':55 'sleev':340 'slimmer':303 'smile':100,206 'snow':33 'solid':196 'song':222 'soon':43 'sourc':229 'source-book':228 'spare':53 'speak':332 'specialist':401 'spectacl':344 'spend':351 'starchi':209 'stare':96 'substanti':161 'surviv':384 'tabletop':81 'taught':212,248 'teach':59 'teeth':106,365 'tenth':126 'thing':26,141 'thirti':113 'though':366 'time':127 'told':148 'tree':6,39,47,72,348,367 'true':320 'trust':156 'turn':8,368,372 'ulcer':337 'underneath':358 'us':398 'valu':357 'wear':335 'white':10 'whitehead':215 'whole':18 'win':284 'wive':373 'woman':264 'world':327 'year':19,64,98,114,130 'young':87 'younger':60,119,304

893	Vuillard:  “The Mother and Sister of the Artist”	317		\nAdmire, when you come here, the glimmering hair  Of the girl; praise her pale Complexion. Think well of her dress  Though that is somewhat out of fashion.  Don’t try to take her hand, but smile for  Her hesitant gentleness. Say the old woman is looking strong  Today; such hardiness. Remark, Perhaps, how she has dressed herself black  Like a priest, and wears that sufficient air  That does become the righteous. As you approach, she will push back  Her chair, shove away her plate And wait, Sitting squat and direct, before The red mahogany chest Massive as some great Safe; will wait, By the table and her greasy plate, The bone half-chewed, her wine half-drained;  She will wait. And fix her steady Eyes on you—the straight stare Of an old politician. Try once to meet her eyes. But fail.  Let your sight Drift—yet never as if hunting for The keys (you keep imagining) hung  By her belt. (They are not there.) Watch, perhaps, that massive chest—the way  It tries to lean Forward, toward her, till it seems to rest  Its whole household’s weight Of linens and clothing and provisions  All on her stiff back. It might be strapped there like the monstrous pack  Of some enchanted pedlar. Dense, self-contained,  Like mercury in a ball, She can support this without strain,  Yet she grows smaller, wrinkling  Like a potato, parched as dung;  It cramps her like a fist.

894	Monet: “Les Nymphéas”	317		\nThe eyelids glowing, some chill morning. O world half-known through opening, twilit lids       Before the vague face clenches into light; O universal waters like a cloud,     Like those first clouds of half-created matter; O all things rising, rising like the fumes     From waters falling, O forever falling; Infinite, the skeletal shells that fall, relinquished,     The snowsoft sift of the diatoms, like selves   Downdrifting age upon age through milky oceans;     O slow downdrifting of the atoms; O island nebulae and O the nebulous islands     Wandering these mists like falsefires, which are true,   Bobbing like milkweed, like warm lanterns bobbing     Through the snowfilled windless air, blinking and passing   As we pass into the memory of women     Who are passing. Within those depths   What ravening? What devouring rage?     How shall our living know its ends of yielding?   These things have taken me as the mouth an orange—     That acrid sweet juice entering every cell;   And I am shared out. I become these things:     These lilies, if these things are water lilies   Which are dancers growing dim across no floor;     These mayflies; whirled dust orbiting in the sun; This blossoming diffused as rushlights; galactic vapors;     Fluorescence into which we pass and penetrate;   O soft as the thighs of women;     O radiance, into which I go on dying ...\n	'acrid':153 'across':181 'age':71,73 'air':110 'atom':82 'becom':165 'blink':111 'blossom':193 'bob':99,105 'cell':158 'chill':8 'clench':23 'cloud':31,35 'creat':39 'dancer':178 'depth':127 'devour':131 'diatom':67 'die':220 'diffus':194 'dim':180 'downdrift':70,79 'dust':187 'end':139 'enter':156 'everi':157 'eyelid':5 'face':22 'fall':51,54,60 'falsefir':95 'first':34 'floor':183 'fluoresc':199 'forev':53 'fume':48 'galact':197 'glow':6 'go':218 'grow':179 'half':13,38 'half-creat':37 'half-known':12 'infinit':55 'island':84,90 'juic':155 'know':137 'known':14 'lantern':104 'les':2 'lid':18 'light':25 'like':29,32,46,68,94,100,102 'lili':169,175 'live':136 'matter':40 'mayfli':185 'memori':119 'milki':75 'milkwe':101 'mist':93 'monet':1 'morn':9 'mouth':149 'nebul':89 'nebula':85 'nymphéa':3 'o':10,26,41,52,77,83,87,206,213 'ocean':76 'open':16 'orang':151 'orbit':188 'pass':113,116,124,203 'penetr':205 'radianc':214 'rage':132 'raven':129 'relinquish':61 'rise':44,45 'rushlight':196 'selv':69 'shall':134 'share':162 'shell':58 'sift':64 'skelet':57 'slow':78 'snowfil':108 'snowsoft':63 'soft':207 'sun':191 'sweet':154 'taken':145 'thigh':210 'thing':43,143,167,172 'true':98 'twilit':17 'univers':27 'upon':72 'vagu':21 'vapor':198 'wander':91 'warm':103 'water':28,50,174 'whirl':186 'windless':109 'within':125 'women':121,212 'world':11 'yield':141
895	The Campus on the Hill	317		\nUp the reputable walks of old established trees They stalk, children of the nouveaux riches; chimes Of the tall Clock Tower drench their heads in blessing:   “I don't wanna play at your house; I don't like you any more.” My house stands opposite, on the other hill, Among meadows, with the orchard fences down and falling;   Deer come almost to the door. You cannot see it, even in this clearest morning. White birds hang in the air between Over the garbage landfill and those homes thereto adjacent,   Hovering slowly, turning, settling down Like the flakes sifting imperceptibly onto the little town   In a waterball of glass. And yet, this morning, beyond this quiet scene, The floating birds, the backyards of the poor, Beyond the shopping plaza, the dead canal, the hillside lying tilted in the air, Tomorrow has broken out today: Riot in Algeria, in Cyprus, in Alabama; Aged in wrong, the empires are declining, And China gathers, soundlessly, like evidence. What shall I say to the young on such a morning?— Mind is the one salvation?—also grammar?— No; my little ones lean not toward revolt. They Are the Whites, the vaguely furiously driven, who resist   Their souls with such passivity As would make Quakers swear. All day, dear Lord, all day   They wear their godhead lightly. They look out from their hill and say, To themselves, “We have nowhere to go but down;   The great destination is to stay.” Surely the nations will be reasonable; They look at the world—don't they?—the world's way?   The clock just now has nothing more to say.\n	'adjac':94 'age':156 'air':84,143 'alabama':155 'algeria':151 'almost':66 'also':185 'among':55 'backyard':126 'beyond':118,130 'bird':80,124 'bless':31 'broken':146 'campus':2 'canal':136 'cannot':71 'children':16 'chime':21 'china':164 'clearest':77 'clock':25,268 'come':65 'cyprus':153 'day':216,220 'dead':135 'dear':217 'declin':162 'deer':64 'destin':245 'door':69 'drench':27 'driven':202 'empir':160 'establish':12 'even':74 'evid':168 'fall':63 'fenc':60 'flake':102 'float':123 'furious':201 'garbag':88 'gather':165 'glass':113 'go':240 'godhead':224 'grammar':186 'great':244 'hang':81 'head':29 'hill':5,54,231 'hillsid':138 'home':92 'hous':39,48 'hover':95 'impercept':104 'landfil':89 'lean':191 'lie':139 'light':225 'like':43,100,167 'littl':107,189 'look':227,256 'lord':218 'make':212 'meadow':56 'mind':180 'morn':78,117,179 'nation':251 'noth':272 'nouveaux':19 'nowher':238 'old':11 'one':183,190 'onto':105 'opposit':50 'orchard':59 'passiv':209 'play':36 'plaza':133 'poor':129 'quaker':213 'quiet':120 'reason':254 'reput':8 'resist':204 'revolt':194 'rich':20 'riot':149 'salvat':184 'say':172,233,275 'scene':121 'see':72 'settl':98 'shall':170 'shop':132 'sift':103 'slowli':96 'soul':206 'soundless':166 'stalk':15 'stand':49 'stay':248 'sure':249 'swear':214 'tall':24 'thereto':93 'tilt':140 'today':148 'tomorrow':144 'toward':193 'tower':26 'town':108 'tree':13 'turn':97 'vagu':200 'walk':9 'wanna':35 'waterbal':111 'way':266 'wear':222 'white':79,198 'world':259,264 'would':211 'wrong':158 'yet':115 'young':175
896	Heart’s Needle	317		\n1 Child of my winter, born When the new fallen soldiers froze In Asia’s steep ravines and fouled the snows,   When I was torn By love I could not still, By fear that silenced my cramped mind To that cold war where, lost, I could not find   My peace in my will, All those days we could keep Your mind a landscape of new snow Where the chilled tenant-farmer finds, below,   His fields asleep In their smooth covering, white As quilts to warm the resting bed Of birth or pain, spotless as paper spread   For me to write, And thinks: Here lies my land Unmarked by agony, the lean foot Of the weasel tracking, the thick trapper’s boot;   And I have planned My chances to restrain The torments of demented summer or   Increase the deepening harvest here before   It snows again. 2     Late April and you are three; today          We dug your garden in the yard.     To curb the damage of your play, Strange dogs at night and the moles tunneling,       Four slender sticks of lath stand guard            Uplifting their thin string.     So you were the first to tramp it down.          And after the earth was sifted close       You brought your watering can to drown All earth and us. But these mixed seeds are pressed       With light loam in their steadfast rows.          Child, we’ve done our best.     Someone will have to weed and spread          The young sprouts. Sprinkle them in the hour       When shadow falls across their bed. You should try to look at them every day       Because when they come to full flower          I will be away. 3 The child between them on the street   Comes to a puddle, lifts his feet     And hangs on their hands. They start   At the live weight and lurch together,   Recoil to swing him through the weather,     Stiffen and pull apart. We read of cold war soldiers that Never gained ground, gave none, but sat       Tight in their chill trenches. Pain seeps up from some cavity Through the ranked teeth in sympathy;       The whole jaw grinds and clenches Till something somewhere has to give.   It’s better the poor soldiers live     In someone else’s hands Than drop where helpless powers fall   On crops and barns, on towns where all       Will burn. And no man stands. For good, they sever and divide Their won and lost land. On each side       Prisoners are returned Excepting a few unknown names.   The peasant plods back and reclaims       His fields that strangers burned And nobody seems very pleased. It’s best. Still, what must not be seized       Clenches the empty fist. I tugged your hand, once, when I hated   Things less: a mere game dislocated       The radius of your wrist. Love’s wishbone, child, although I’ve gone   As men must and let you be drawn       Off to appease another, It may help that a Chinese play Or Solomon himself might say     I am your real mother. 4          No one can tell you why       the season will not wait;          the night I told you I must leave, you wept a fearful rate                to stay up late.          Now that it’s turning Fall,       we go to take our walk          among municipal flowers, to steal one off its stalk,                to try and talk.          We huff like windy giants     scattering with our breath            gray-headed dandelions; Spring is the cold wind's aftermath.              The poet saith.          But the asters, too, are gray,     ghost-gray. Last night’s cold            is sending on their way petunias and dwarf marigold,              hunched sick and old.          Like nerves caught in a graph,       the morning-glory vines          frost has erased by half still scrawl across their rigid twines.                Like broken lines          of verses I can’t make.     In its unraveling loom          we find a flower to take, with some late buds that might still bloom,                back to your room.          Night comes and the stiff dew.       I’m told a friend’s child cried            because a cricket, who had minstreled every night outside                her window, died. 5 Winter again and it is snowing;   Although you are still three,   You are already growing Strange to me. You chatter about new playmates, sing   Strange songs; you do not know   Hey ding-a-ding-a-ding 	'1':4 '2':149 '3':277 '4':499 '5':681 'across':254,620 'aftermath':572 'agoni':113 'alreadi':695 'although':466,688 'among':540 'anoth':481 'apart':316 'appeas':480 'april':151 'asia':17 'asleep':80 'aster':578 'away':276 'back':417,651 'barn':381 'bed':92,256 'best':235,432 'better':362 'birth':94 'bloom':650 'boot':125 'born':9 'breath':561 'broken':625 'brought':207 'bud':646 'burn':387,424 'caught':604 'caviti':341 'chanc':131 'chatter':701 'child':5,230,279,465,667 'chill':72,334 'chines':487 'clench':353,439 'close':205 'cold':44,320,569,588 'come':269,285,656 'could':32,49,61 'cover':84 'cramp':40 'cri':668 'cricket':671 'crop':379 'curb':165 'damag':167 'dandelion':565 'day':59,265 'deepen':142 'dement':137 'dew':660 'die':680 'ding':714,716,718 'ding-a-ding-a-d':713 'disloc':456 'divid':397 'dog':172 'done':233 'drawn':477 'drop':373 'drown':212 'dug':158 'dwarf':596 'earth':202,214 'els':369 'empti':441 'eras':615 'everi':264,675 'except':409 'fall':253,377,533 'fallen':13 'farmer':75 'fear':36,522 'feet':291 'field':79,421 'find':51,76,638 'first':194 'fist':442 'flower':272,542,640 'foot':116 'foul':22 'four':179 'friend':665 'frost':613 'froze':15 'full':271 'gain':325 'game':455 'garden':160 'gave':327 'ghost':583 'ghost-gray':582 'giant':557 'give':359 'glori':611 'go':535 'gone':469 'good':393 'graph':607 'gray':563,581,584 'gray-head':562 'grind':351 'ground':326 'grow':696 'guard':185 'half':617 'hand':296,371,446 'hang':293 'harvest':143 'hate':450 'head':564 'heart':1 'help':484 'helpless':375 'hey':712 'hour':250 'huff':554 'hunch':598 'increas':140 'jaw':350 'keep':62 'know':711 'land':110,402 'landscap':66 'last':585 'late':150,527,645 'lath':183 'lean':115 'leav':518 'less':452 'let':474 'lie':108 'lift':289 'light':224 'like':555,602,624 'line':626 'live':301,366 'loam':225 'look':261 'loom':636 'lost':47,401 'love':30,462 'lurch':304 'm':662 'make':632 'man':390 'marigold':597 'may':483 'men':471 'mere':454 'might':492,648 'mind':41,64 'minstrel':674 'mix':219 'mole':177 'morn':610 'morning-glori':609 'mother':498 'municip':541 'must':435,472,517 'name':413 'needl':3 'nerv':603 'never':324 'new':12,68,703 'night':174,512,586,655,676 'nobodi':426 'none':328 'old':601 'one':501,545 'outsid':677 'pain':96,336 'paper':99 'peac':53 'peasant':415 'petunia':594 'plan':129 'play':170,488 'playmat':704 'pleas':429 'plod':416 'poet':574 'poor':364 'power':376 'press':222 'prison':406 'puddl':288 'pull':315 'quilt':87 'radius':458 'rank':344 'rate':523 'ravin':20 'read':318 'real':497 'reclaim':419 'recoil':306 'rest':91 'restrain':133 'return':408 'rigid':622 'room':654 'row':229 'saith':575 'sat':330 'say':493 'scatter':558 'scrawl':619 'season':507 'seed':220 'seem':427 'seep':337 'seiz':438 'send':590 'sever':395 'shadow':252 'sick':599 'side':405 'sift':204 'silenc':38 'sing':705 'slender':180 'smooth':83 'snow':24,69,147,687 'soldier':14,322,365 'solomon':490 'someon':236,368 'someth':355 'somewher':356 'song':707 'spotless':97 'spread':100,242 'spring':566 'sprinkl':246 'sprout':245 'stalk':548 'stand':184,391 'start':298 'stay':525 'steadfast':228 'steal':544 'steep':19 'stick':181 'stiff':659 'stiffen':313 'still':34,433,618,649,691 'strang':171,697,706 'stranger':423 'street':284 'string':189 'summer':138 'swing':308 'sympathi':347 'take':537,642 'talk':552 'teeth':345 'tell':503 'tenant':74 'tenant-farm':73 'thick':122 'thin':188 'thing':451 'think':106 'three':155,692 'tight':331 'till':354 'today':156 'togeth':305 'told':514,663 'torment':135 'torn':28 'town':383 'track':120 'tramp':196 'trapper':123 'trench':335 'tri':259,550 'tug':444 'tunnel':178 'turn':532 'twine':623 'unknown':412 'unmark':111 'unravel':635 'uplift':186 'us':216 've':232,468 'vers':628 'vine':612 'wait':510 'walk':539 'war':45,321 'warm':89 'water':209 'way':593 'weasel':119 'weather':312 'weed':240 'weight':302 'wept':520 'white':85 'whole':349 'wind':570 'windi':556 'window':679 'winter':8,682 'wishbon':464 'won':399 'wrist':461 'write':104 'yard':163 'young':244
897	Mementos, 1	317		\nSorting out letters and piles of my old     Canceled checks, old clippings, and yellow note cards   That meant something once, I happened to find     Your picture. That picture. I stopped there cold,   Like a man raking piles of dead leaves in his yard              Who has turned up a severed hand. Still, that first second, I was glad: you stand     Just as you stood—shy, delicate, slender, In that long gown of green lace netting and daisies     That you wore to our first dance. The sight of you stunned   Us all. Well, our needs were different, then,              And our ideals came easy. Then through the war and those two long years     Overseas, the Japanese dead in their shacks   Among dishes, dolls, and lost shoes; I carried     This glimpse of you, there, to choke down my fear,   Prove it had been, that it might come back.              That was before we got married. —Before we drained out one another’s force       With lies, self-denial, unspoken regret And the sick eyes that blame; before the divorce     And the treachery. Say it: before we met. Still,   I put back your picture. Someday, in due course,              I will find that it’s still there.\n	'1':2 'among':120 'anoth':158 'back':146,188 'blame':173 'came':102 'cancel':11 'card':18 'carri':127 'check':12 'choke':134 'clip':14 'cold':34 'come':145 'cours':194 'daisi':78 'danc':85 'dead':41,116 'delic':67 'denial':165 'differ':97 'dish':121 'divorc':176 'doll':122 'drain':155 'due':193 'easi':103 'eye':171 'fear':137 'find':26,197 'first':55,84 'forc':160 'glad':59 'glimps':129 'got':151 'gown':72 'green':74 'hand':52 'happen':24 'ideal':101 'japanes':115 'lace':75 'leav':42 'letter':5 'lie':162 'like':35 'long':71,111 'lost':124 'man':37 'marri':152 'meant':20 'memento':1 'met':184 'might':144 'need':95 'net':76 'note':17 'old':10,13 'one':157 'oversea':113 'pictur':28,30,190 'pile':7,39 'prove':138 'put':187 'rake':38 'regret':167 'say':180 'second':56 'self':164 'self-deni':163 'sever':51 'shack':119 'shi':66 'shoe':125 'sick':170 'sight':87 'slender':68 'someday':191 'someth':21 'sort':3 'stand':61 'still':53,185,201 'stood':65 'stop':32 'stun':90 'treacheri':179 'turn':48 'two':110 'unspoken':166 'us':91 'war':107 'well':93 'wore':81 'yard':45 'year':112 'yellow':16
898	A Locked House	317		\nAs we drove back, crossing the hill, The house still Hidden in the trees, I always thought— A fool’s fear—that it might have caught   Fire, someone could have broken in.   As if things must have been Too good here. Still, we always found   It locked tight, safe and sound. I mentioned that, once, as a joke;   No doubt we spoke Of the absurdity To fear some dour god’s jealousy   Of our good fortune. From the farm   Next door, our neighbors saw no harm   Came to the things we cared for here.   What did we have to fear? Maybe I should have thought: all Such things rot, fall— Barns, houses, furniture. We two are stronger than we were Apart; we’ve grown Together. Everything we own Can burn; we know what counts—some such   Idea. We said as much. We’d watched friends driven to betray;   Felt that love drained away Some self they need. We’d said love, like a growth, can feed   On hate we turn in and disguise; We warned ourselves. That you might despise   Me—hate all we both loved best— None of us ever guessed. The house still stands, locked, as it stood   Untouched a good Two years after you went. Some things passed in the settlement;   Some things slipped away. Enough’s left   That I come back sometimes. The theft   And vandalism were our own. Maybe we should have known.\n	'absurd':68 'alway':19,47 'apart':124 'away':156,221 'back':7,228 'barn':114 'best':190 'betray':151 'broken':34 'burn':133 'came':90 'care':95 'caught':29 'come':227 'could':32 'count':137 'cross':8 'd':146,162 'despis':183 'disguis':176 'door':84 'doubt':63 'dour':72 'drain':155 'driven':149 'drove':6 'enough':222 'ever':194 'everyth':129 'fall':113 'farm':82 'fear':24,70,103 'feed':169 'felt':152 'fire':30 'fool':22 'fortun':79 'found':48 'friend':148 'furnitur':116 'god':73 'good':43,78,206 'grown':127 'growth':167 'guess':195 'harm':89 'hate':171,185 'hidden':14 'hill':10 'hous':3,12,115,197 'idea':140 'jealousi':75 'joke':61 'know':135 'known':241 'left':224 'like':165 'lock':2,50,200 'love':154,164,189 'mayb':104,237 'mention':56 'might':27,182 'much':144 'must':39 'need':160 'neighbor':86 'next':83 'none':191 'pass':214 'rot':112 'safe':52 'said':142,163 'saw':87 'self':158 'settlement':217 'slip':220 'someon':31 'sometim':229 'sound':54 'spoke':65 'stand':199 'still':13,45,198 'stood':203 'stronger':120 'theft':231 'thing':38,93,111,213,219 'thought':20,108 'tight':51 'togeth':128 'tree':17 'turn':173 'two':118,207 'untouch':204 'us':193 'vandal':233 've':126 'warn':178 'watch':147 'went':211 'year':208

900	Magda Goebbels (30 April 1945)	317		\nThis is the needle that we give Soldiers and children when they live   Near the front in primitive     Conditions or real dangers; This is the spoon we use to feed   Men trapped in trouble or in need,   When weakness or bad luck might lead     Them to the hands of strangers. This is the room where you can sleep   Your sleep out, curled up under deep   Layers of covering that will keep     You safe till all harm’s past. This is the bed where you can rest   In perfect silence, undistressed By noise or nightmares, as my breast       Once held you soft but fast. This is the Doctor who has brought   Your needle with your special shot   To quiet you; you won’t get caught     Off guard or unprepared. I am your nurse who’ll comfort you;   I nursed you, fed you till you grew   Too big to feed; now you’re all through     Fretting or feeling scared. This is the glass tube that contains Calm that will spread down through your veins   To free you finally from all pains     Of going on in error. This tiny pinprick sets the germ Inside you that fills out its term Till you can feel yourself grow firm     Against all doubt, all terror. Into this spoon I break the pill   That stiffens the unsteady will   And hardens you against the chill     Voice of a world of lies. This amber medicine implants   Steadfastness in your blood; this grants   Immunity from greed and chance,     And from all compromise. This is the serum that can cure Weak hearts; these pure, clear drops insure   You’ll face what comes and can endure       The test; you’ll never falter. This is the potion that preserves You in a faith that never swerves; This sets the pattern of your nerves     Too firm for you to alter. I set this spoon between your tight   Teeth, as I gave you your first bite;   This satisfies your appetite     For other nourishment. Take this on your tongue; this do   Remembering your mother who So loved her Leader she stayed true     When all the others went, When every friend proved false, in the   Delirium of treachery On every hand, when even He     Had turned His face aside. He shut himself in with His whore; Then, though I screamed outside His door,   Said He’d not see me anymore.     They both took cyanide. Open wide, now, little bird; I who sang you your first word Soothe away every sound you’ve heard       Except your Leader’s voice. Close your eyes, now; take your death.   Once we slapped you to take breath.   Vengeance is mine, the Lord God saith     And cancels each last choice. Once, my first words marked out your mind;   Just as our Leader’s phrases bind All hearts to Him, building a blind     Loyalty through the nation, We shape you into a pure form. Trapped, our best soldiers tricked the storm,   The Reds: those last hours, they felt warm       Who stood fast to their station. You needn’t fear what your life meant; You won’t curse how your hours were spent;   You’ll grow like your own monument     To all things sure and good, Fixed like a frieze in high relief Of granite figures that our Chief Accepts into His true belief,     His true blood-brotherhood. You’ll never bite the hand that fed you,   Won’t turn away from those that bred you,   Comforted your nights and led you     Into the thought of virtue; You won’t be turned from your own bed;   Won’t turn into that thing you dread;   No new betrayal lies ahead;     Now no one else can hurt you.\n	'1945':5 '30':3 'accept':550 'ahead':610 'alter':311 'amber':240 'anymor':398 'appetit':330 'april':4 'asid':377 'away':416,572 'bad':46 'bed':87,597 'belief':554 'best':488 'betray':608 'big':151 'bind':467 'bird':407 'bite':326,563 'blind':474 'blood':246,558 'blood-brotherhood':557 'break':219 'breast':102 'breath':440 'bred':576 'brotherhood':559 'brought':115 'build':472 'calm':170 'cancel':449 'caught':129 'chanc':253 'chief':549 'children':15 'chill':232 'choic':452 'clear':269 'close':427 'come':276 'comfort':140,578 'compromis':257 'condit':24 'contain':169 'cover':73 'cure':264 'curl':67 'curs':518 'cyanid':402 'd':394 'danger':27 'death':433 'deep':70 'delirium':364 'doctor':112 'door':391 'doubt':212 'dread':605 'drop':270 'els':614 'endur':279 'error':189 'even':371 'everi':358,368,417 'except':422 'eye':429 'face':274,376 'faith':295 'fals':361 'falter':285 'fast':108,503 'fear':510 'fed':145,567 'feed':35,153 'feel':161,206 'felt':499 'figur':546 'fill':199 'final':181 'firm':209,307 'first':325,413,455 'fix':537 'form':485 'free':179 'fret':159 'friend':359 'friez':540 'front':21 'gave':322 'germ':195 'get':128 'give':12 'glass':166 'go':186 'god':446 'goebbel':2 'good':536 'granit':545 'grant':248 'greed':251 'grew':149 'grow':208,526 'guard':131 'hand':53,369,565 'harden':228 'harm':81 'heard':421 'heart':266,469 'held':104 'high':542 'hour':497,521 'hurt':616 'immun':249 'implant':242 'insid':196 'insur':271 'keep':76 'last':451,496 'layer':71 'lead':49 'leader':348,424,464 'led':582 'lie':238,609 'life':513 'like':527,538 'littl':406 'live':18 'll':139,273,283,525,561 'lord':445 'love':346 'loyalti':475 'luck':47 'magda':1 'mark':457 'meant':514 'medicin':241 'men':36 'might':48 'mind':460 'mine':443 'monument':530 'mother':343 'nation':478 'near':19 'need':42 'needl':9,117 'needn':508 'nerv':305 'never':284,297,562 'new':607 'night':580 'nightmar':99 'nois':97 'nourish':333 'nurs':137,143 'one':613 'open':403 'other':355 'outsid':389 'pain':184 'past':83 'pattern':302 'perfect':93 'phrase':466 'pill':221 'pinprick':192 'potion':289 'preserv':291 'primit':23 'prove':360 'pure':268,484 'quiet':123 're':156 'real':26 'red':494 'relief':543 'rememb':341 'rest':91 'room':59 'safe':78 'said':392 'saith':447 'sang':410 'satisfi':328 'scare':162 'scream':388 'see':396 'serum':261 'set':193,300,313 'shape':480 'shot':121 'shut':379 'silenc':94 'slap':436 'sleep':63,65 'soft':106 'soldier':13,489 'sooth':415 'sound':418 'special':120 'spent':523 'spoon':31,217,315 'spread':173 'station':506 'stay':350 'steadfast':243 'stiffen':223 'stood':502 'storm':492 'stranger':55 'sure':534 'swerv':298 'take':334,431,439 'teeth':319 'term':202 'terror':214 'test':281 'thing':533,603 'though':386 'thought':586 'tight':318 'till':79,147,203 'tini':191 'tongu':338 'took':401 'trap':37,486 'treacheri':366 'trick':490 'troubl':39 'true':351,553,556 'tube':167 'turn':374,571,593,600 'undistress':95 'unprepar':133 'unsteadi':225 'use':33 've':420 'vein':177 'vengeanc':441 'virtu':588 'voic':233,426 'warm':500 'weak':44,265 'went':356 'whore':384 'wide':404 'won':126,516,569,590,598 'word':414,456 'world':236
901	Dr. Joseph Goebbels (22 April 1945)	317		\nStand back, make way, you mindless scum,   Squire Voland the Seducer’s come— Old Bock from Babelsberg whose tower   Falls silent now, whose shrunken power   For lies or lays comes hobbling home   Into this concrete catacomb. Here’s Runty Joe, the cunt collector   Who grew to greatness, first erector   Of myths and missions, fibs and fables, Who pulled the wool then turned the tables:   He piped the tunes and called the dance   Where shirtless countries lost their pants. Goatfooted Pan, the nation’s gander To whom Pan-Germans all played pander,   The jovial cob-swan quick to cover   Lida Baarova, his check-list lover;   Swellfoot the Tyrant, he could riddle   Men’s minds away, hi-diddle-diddle. Our little Doctor, Joe the Gimp   Comes back to limpness and his limp:   Hephaistos, Vulcan the lame smith   Whose net of lies caught one true myth:   His wife, the famous beauty, whored   By numbskull Mars, the dull warlord. What if I took my little fling   At conquest, at adventuring. Pried the lid of Pandora’s box off— There’s nothing there to bring your rocks off.   I never saw one fucking day   So fine I courted it to stay. If I got snarled in my own mesh Of thighs and bellies, who wants flesh?   I never hankered after matter. Let Hermann swell up, grosser, fatter,   Weighed down by medals, houses, clothing;   They leave me lean, secured in loathing. As a young man, I pricked the bubble   Of every creed; I saw that rubble And offered myself the realms of earth   Just to say Yes. But what’s it worth?   No thank you, Ma’am. Behold the Ram   Of God: I doubt, therefore I am. Here I forsake that long pricktease   Of histories, hopes, lusts, luxuries.   I come back to my first Ideal— The vacancy that’s always real.   I sniffed out all life’s openings:   I loved only the holes in things. So strip down one bare cell for this   Lay Brother of the last abyss. To me, still, all abstractions smell;   My head and nose clear in this cell   Of concrete, this confession booth   Where liars face up to blank truth. My tongue lashed millions to the knife;   Here, I’ll hold hands with my soiled wife.   My lies piped men out, hot to slaughter;   Here, I’ll read stories to my daughter   Then hack off all relations, choose   Only the Nothing you can’t lose, Send back this body, fixed in its   Infantile paralysis. I was born small; I shall grow less   Till I burst into Nothingness, That slot in time where only pure   Spirit extends, absent and sure. I am that spirit that denies, High Priest of Laymen, Prince of Lies.   Your house is founded on my rock;   Truth crows; now I deny my cock.   Jock of this walk, I turn down all,   Robbing my Peter to play Paul. I give up all goods I possess To build my faith on faithlessness. Black Peter, I belie my Lord— You’ve got to die to spread the Word.   Now the last act; there’s no sequel. Soon, once more, all things shall be equal.\n	'1945':6 '22':4 'absent':446 'abstract':348 'abyss':343 'act':521 'adventur':176 'alway':314 'april':5 'away':123 'baarova':108 'babelsberg':23 'back':8,135,305,416 'bare':334 'beauti':158 'behold':282 'beli':506 'belli':218 'black':503 'blank':368 'bock':21 'bodi':418 'booth':362 'born':426 'box':183 'bring':190 'brother':339 'bubbl':253 'build':498 'burst':434 'call':76 'catacomb':42 'caught':150 'cell':335,357 'check':111 'check-list':110 'choos':407 'clear':354 'cloth':238 'cob':102 'cob-swan':101 'cock':475 'collector':49 'come':19,36,134,304 'concret':41,359 'confess':361 'conquest':174 'could':118 'countri':81 'court':203 'cover':106 'creed':256 'crow':470 'cunt':48 'danc':78 'daughter':401 'day':199 'deni':454,473 'diddl':126,127 'die':513 'doctor':130 'doubt':288 'dr':1 'dull':164 'earth':267 'equal':533 'erector':55 'everi':255 'extend':445 'fabl':62 'face':365 'faith':500 'faithless':502 'fall':26 'famous':157 'fatter':232 'fib':60 'fine':201 'first':54,308 'fix':419 'flesh':221 'fling':172 'forsak':294 'found':465 'fuck':198 'gander':90 'german':95 'gimp':133 'give':491 'goatfoot':85 'god':286 'goebbel':3 'good':494 'got':209,511 'great':53 'grew':51 'grosser':231 'grow':430 'hack':403 'hand':381 'hanker':224 'head':351 'hephaisto':141 'hermann':228 'hi':125 'hi-diddle-diddl':124 'high':455 'histori':299 'hobbl':37 'hold':380 'hole':327 'home':38 'hope':300 'hot':391 'hous':237,463 'ideal':309 'infantil':422 'jock':476 'joe':46,131 'joseph':2 'jovial':100 'knife':376 'lame':144 'lash':372 'last':342,520 'lay':35,338 'laymen':458 'lean':242 'leav':240 'less':431 'let':227 'liar':364 'lid':179 'lida':107 'lie':33,149,387,461 'life':320 'limp':137,140 'list':112 'littl':129,171 'll':379,396 'loath':245 'long':296 'lord':508 'lose':414 'lost':82 'love':324 'lover':113 'lust':301 'luxuri':302 'ma':280 'make':9 'man':249 'mar':162 'matter':226 'medal':236 'men':120,389 'mesh':214 'million':373 'mind':122 'mindless':12 'mission':59 'myth':57,153 'nation':88 'net':147 'never':195,223 'nose':353 'noth':187,410 'nothing':436 'numbskul':161 'offer':262 'old':20 'one':151,197,333 'open':322 'pan':86,94 'pan-german':93 'pander':98 'pandora':181 'pant':84 'paralysi':423 'paul':489 'peter':486,504 'pipe':72,388 'play':97,488 'possess':496 'power':31 'pri':177 'prick':251 'prickteas':297 'priest':456 'princ':459 'pull':64 'pure':443 'quick':104 'ram':284 'read':397 'real':315 'realm':265 'relat':406 'riddl':119 'rob':484 'rock':192,468 'rubbl':260 'runti':45 'saw':196,258 'say':270 'scum':13 'secur':243 'seduc':17 'send':415 'sequel':525 'shall':429,531 'shirtless':80 'shrunken':30 'silent':27 'slaughter':393 'slot':438 'small':427 'smell':349 'smith':145 'snarl':210 'snif':317 'soil':384 'soon':526 'spirit':444,452 'spread':515 'squir':14 'stand':7 'stay':206 'still':346 'stori':398 'strip':331 'sure':448 'swan':103 'swell':229 'swellfoot':114 'tabl':70 'thank':278 'therefor':289 'thigh':216 'thing':329,530 'till':432 'time':440 'tongu':371 'took':169 'tower':25 'true':152 'truth':369,469 'tune':74 'turn':68,481 'tyrant':116 'vacanc':311 've':510 'voland':15 'vulcan':142 'walk':479 'want':220 'warlord':165 'way':10 'weigh':233 'whore':159 'whose':24,29,146 'wife':155,385 'wool':66 'word':517 'worth':276 'yes':271 'young':248

905	The Bad Old Days	318		\nThe summer of nineteen eighteen   I read The Jungle and The Research Magnificent. That fall   My father died and my aunt   Took me to Chicago to live.   The first thing I did was to take   A streetcar to the stockyards.   In the winter afternoon,   Gritty and fetid, I walked Through the filthy snow, through the   Squalid streets, looking shyly   Into the people’s faces, Those who were home in the daytime.   Debauched and exhausted faces,   Starved and looted brains, faces   Like the faces in the senile   And insane wards of charity   Hospitals. Predatory Faces of little children. Then as the soiled twilight darkened,   Under the green gas lamps, and the   Sputtering purple arc lamps,   The faces of the men coming Home from work, some still alive with   The last pulse of hope or courage,   Some sly and bitter, some smart and   Silly, most of them already   Broken and empty, no life,   Only blinding tiredness, worse   Than any tired animal.   The sour smells of a thousand   Suppers of fried potatoes and   Fried cabbage bled into the street.   I was giddy and sick, and out   Of my misery I felt rising   A terrible anger and out Of the anger, an absolute vow.   Today the evil is clean And prosperous, but it is   Everywhere, you don’t have to   Take a streetcar to find it, And it is the same evil. And the misery, and the Anger, and the vow are the same.\n	'absolut':203 'afternoon':48 'aliv':130 'alreadi':150 'anger':196,201,238 'anim':163 'arc':117 'aunt':25 'bad':2 'bitter':142 'bled':177 'blind':157 'brain':83 'broken':151 'cabbag':176 'chariti':95 'chicago':29 'children':101 'clean':209 'come':124 'courag':138 'darken':107 'day':4 'daytim':75 'debauch':76 'die':22 'eighteen':9 'empti':153 'everywher':215 'evil':207,232 'exhaust':78 'face':68,79,84,87,98,120 'fall':19 'father':21 'felt':192 'fetid':51 'filthi':56 'find':225 'first':33 'fri':172,175 'gas':111 'giddi':183 'green':110 'gritti':49 'home':72,125 'hope':136 'hospit':96 'insan':92 'jungl':13 'lamp':112,118 'last':133 'life':155 'like':85 'littl':100 'live':31 'look':62 'loot':82 'magnific':17 'men':123 'miseri':190,235 'nineteen':8 'old':3 'peopl':66 'potato':173 'predatori':97 'prosper':211 'puls':134 'purpl':116 'read':11 'research':16 'rise':193 'senil':90 'shyli':63 'sick':185 'silli':146 'sli':140 'smart':144 'smell':166 'snow':57 'soil':105 'sour':165 'sputter':115 'squalid':60 'starv':80 'still':129 'stockyard':44 'street':61,180 'streetcar':41,223 'summer':6 'supper':170 'take':39,221 'terribl':195 'thing':34 'thousand':169 'tire':162 'tired':158 'today':205 'took':26 'twilight':106 'vow':204,241 'walk':53 'ward':93 'winter':47 'work':127 'wors':159

I flip   It idly in the air and Catch it and do a coin trick   To amuse my little girl. Suddenly everything slips aside.   I see my father Doing the very same thing,   Whistling “Beautiful Dreamer,”   His breath smelling richly Of whiskey and cigars. I can   Hear him coming home drunk   From the Elks’ Club in Elkhart   Indiana, bumping the Chairs in the dark.

907	The Wheel Revolves	318		\nYou were a girl of satin and gauze Now you are my mountain and waterfall companion.   Long ago I read those lines of Po Chu I   Written in his middle age. Young as I was they touched me. I never thought in my own middle age   I would have a beautiful young dancer To wander with me by falling crystal waters,   Among mountains of snow and granite,   Least of all that unlike Po’s girl She would be my very daughter. The earth turns towards the sun.   Summer comes to the mountains.   Blue grouse drum in the red fir woods   All the bright long days. You put blue jay and flicker feathers   In your hair. Two and two violet green swallows   Play over the lake. The blue birds have come back To nest on the little island. The swallows sip water on the wing   And play at love and dodge and swoop Just like the swallows that swirl   Under and over the Ponte Vecchio.   Light rain crosses the lake Hissing faintly. After the rain There are giant puffballs with tortoise shell backs   At the edge of the meadow. Snows of a thousand winters Melt in the sun of one summer.   Wild cyclamen bloom by the stream.   Trout veer in the transparent current. In the evening marmots bark in the rocks. The Scorpion curls over the glimmering ice field. A white crowned night sparrow sings as the moon sets.   Thunder growls far off. Our campfire is a single light Amongst a hundred peaks and waterfalls. The manifold voices of falling water Talk all night. Wrapped in your down bag   Starlight on your cheeks and eyelids Your breath comes and goes In a tiny cloud in the frosty night. Ten thousand birds sing in the sunrise. Ten thousand years revolve without change. All this will never be again.\n	'age':34,49 'ago':21 'among':65 'amongst':252 'back':134,185 'bag':271 'bark':220 'beauti':54 'bird':131,293 'bloom':206 'blue':96,111,130 'breath':279 'bright':106 'campfir':247 'chang':303 'cheek':275 'chu':28 'cloud':286 'come':92,133,280 'companion':19 'cross':170 'crown':234 'crystal':63 'curl':226 'current':215 'cyclamen':205 'dancer':56 'daughter':84 'day':108 'dodg':153 'drum':98 'earth':86 'edg':188 'even':218 'eyelid':277 'faint':174 'fall':62,262 'far':244 'feather':115 'field':231 'fir':102 'flicker':114 'frosti':289 'gauz':11 'giant':180 'girl':7,78 'glimmer':229 'goe':282 'granit':70 'green':123 'grous':97 'growl':243 'hair':118 'hiss':173 'hundr':254 'ice':230 'island':140 'jay':112 'lake':128,172 'least':71 'light':168,251 'like':157 'line':25 'littl':139 'long':20,107 'love':151 'manifold':259 'marmot':219 'meadow':191 'melt':197 'middl':33,48 'moon':240 'mountain':16,66,95 'nest':136 'never':43,307 'night':235,266,290 'one':202 'peak':255 'play':125,149 'po':27,76 'pont':166 'puffbal':181 'put':110 'rain':169,177 'read':23 'red':101 'revolv':3,301 'rock':223 'satin':9 'scorpion':225 'set':241 'shell':184 'sing':237,294 'singl':250 'sip':143 'snow':68,192 'sparrow':236 'starlight':272 'stream':209 'summer':91,203 'sun':90,200 'sunris':297 'swallow':124,142,159 'swirl':161 'swoop':155 'talk':264 'ten':291,298 'thought':44 'thousand':195,292,299 'thunder':242 'tini':285 'tortois':183 'touch':40 'toward':88 'transpar':214 'trout':210 'turn':87 'two':119,121 'unlik':75 'vecchio':167 'veer':211 'violet':122 'voic':260 'wander':58 'water':64,144,263 'waterfal':18,257 'wheel':2 'white':233 'wild':204 'wing':147 'winter':196 'without':302 'wood':103 'would':51,80 'wrap':267 'written':30 'year':300 'young':35,55
908	Lyell’s Hypothesis Again	318		\nThe mountain road ends here,   Broken away in the chasm where   The bridge washed out years ago.   The first scarlet larkspur glitters   In the first patch of April Morning sunlight. The engorged creek   Roars and rustles like a military   Ball. Here by the waterfall,   Insuperable life, flushed With the equinox, sentient   And sentimental, falls away To the sea and death. The tissue   Of sympathy and agony That binds the flesh in its Nessus' shirt;   The clotted cobweb of unself   And self; sheds itself and flecks   The sun's bed with darts of blossom   Like flagellant blood above   The water bursting in the vibrant   Air. This ego, bound by personal   Tragedy and the vast Impersonal vindictiveness Of the ruined and ruining world,   Pauses in this immortality, As passionate, as apathetic, As the lava flow that burned here once;   And stopped here; and said, 'This far   And no further.' And spoke thereafter   In the simple diction of stone. Naked in the warm April air,   We lie under the redwoods,   In the sunny lee of a cliff.   As you kneel above me I see   Tiny red marks on your flanks Like bites, where the redwood cones   Have pressed into your flesh.   You can find just the same marks   In the lignite in the cliff Over our heads.

909	Toward an Organic Philosophy	318		\nSPRING, COAST RANGE The glow of my campfire is dark red and flameless,   The circle of white ash widens around it. I get up and walk off in the moonlight and each time   I look back the red is deeper and the light smaller.   Scorpio rises late with Mars caught in his claw;   The moon has come before them, the light   Like a choir of children in the young laurel trees.   It is April; the shad, the hot headed fish, Climbs the rivers; there is trillium in the damp canyons;   The foetid adder’s tongue lolls by the waterfall. There was a farm at this campsite once, it is almost gone now.   There were sheep here after the farm, and fire   Long ago burned the redwoods out of the gulch,   The Douglas fir off the ridge; today the soil   Is stony and incoherent, the small stones lie flat   And plate the surface like scales. Twenty years ago the spreading gully Toppled the big oak over onto the house.   Now there is nothing left but the foundations   Hidden in poison oak, and above on the ridge,   Six lonely, ominous fenceposts; The redwood beams of the barn make a footbridge   Over the deep waterless creek bed; The hills are covered with wild oats Dry and white by midsummer. I walk in the random survivals of the orchard.   In a patch of moonlight a mole Shakes his tunnel like an angry vein; Orion walks waist deep in the fog coming in from the ocean;   Leo crouches under the zenith. There are tiny hard fruits already on the plum trees.   The purity of the apple blossoms is incredible.   As the wind dies down their fragrance Clusters around them like thick smoke. All the day they roared with bees, in the moonlight   They are silent and immaculate.              SPRING, SIERRA NEVADA Once more golden Scorpio glows over the col   Above Deadman Canyon, orderly and brilliant,   Like an inspiration in the brain of Archimedes.   I have seen its light over the warm sea, Over the coconut beaches, phosphorescent and pulsing;   And the living light in the water Shivering away from the swimming hand, Creeping against the lips, filling the floating hair. Here where the glaciers have been and the snow stays late,   The stone is clean as light, the light steady as stone. The relationship of stone, ice and stars is systematic and enduring:   Novelty emerges after centuries, a rock spalls from the cliffs,   The glacier contracts and turns grayer, The stream cuts new sinuosities in the meadow,   The sun moves through space and the earth with it,   The stars change places.                                     The snow has lasted longer this year,   Than anyone can remember. The lowest meadow is a lake,   The next two are snowfields, the pass is covered with snow,   Only the steepest rocks are bare. Between the pass   And the last meadow the snowfield gapes for a hundred feet,   In a narrow blue chasm through which a waterfall drops,   Spangled with sunset at the top, black and muscular   Where it disappears again in the snow. The world is filled with hidden running water   That pounds in the ears like ether; The granite needles rise from the snow, pale as steel;   Above the copper mine the cliff is blood red,   The white snow breaks at the edge of it; The sky comes close to my eyes like the blue eyes   Of someone kissed in sleep.                                         I descend to camp, To the young, sticky, wrinkled aspen leaves, To the first violets and wild cyclamen, And cook supper in the blue twilight. All night deer pass over the snow on sharp hooves,   In the darkness their cold muzzles find the new grass   At the edge of the snow.              FALL, SIERRA NEVADA This morning the hermit thrush was absent at breakfast,   His place was taken by a family of chickadees;   At noon a flock of humming birds passed south,   Whirling in the wind up over the saddle between   Ritter and Banner, following the migration lane   Of the Sierra crest southward to Guatemala. All day cloud shadows have moved over the face of the mountain,   The shadow of a golden eagle weaving between them   Over the face of the glacier. At sunset the half-moon rides on the bent back of the Scorpion,   The Great Bear kneels on the mountain. Ten degrees below the moon Venus sets in the haze arising from the Great Valley. Jupiter, in opposition to the sun, rises in the alpenglow   Between the burnt peaks. The ventriloquial belling   Of an owl mingles with the bells of the waterfall.   Now there is distant thunder on the east wind.   The east face of the mountain above me Is lit with far off lightnings and the sky Above the pass blazes momentarily like an aurora.   It is storming in the White Mountains, On the arid fourteen-thousand-foot peaks; Rain is falling on the narrow gray ranges And dark sedge meadows and white salt flats of Nevada.   Just before moonset a small dense cumulus cloud,   Gleaming like a grape cluster of metal, Moves over the Sierra crest and grows down the westward slope. Frost, the color and quality of the cloud, Lies over all the marsh below my campsite. The wiry clumps of dwarfed whitebark pines   Are smoky and indistinct in the moonlight,   Only their shadows are really visible. The lake is immobile and holds the stars And the peaks deep in itself without a quiver.   In the shallows the geometrical tendrils of ice   Spread their wonderful mathematics in silence.   All night the eyes of deer shine for an instant As they cross the radius of my firelight. In the morning the trail will look like a sheep driveway,   All the tracks will point down to the lower canyon.   “Thus,” says Tyndall, “the concerns of this little place   Are changed and fashioned by the obliquity of the earth’s axis, The chain of dependence which runs through creation,   And links the roll of a planet alike with the interests   Of marmots and of men.”\n	'absent':633 'adder':97

910	Climbing Milestone Mountain, August 22, 1937	318		\nFor a month now, wandering over the Sierras,   A poem had been gathering in my mind,   Details of significance and rhythm, The way poems do, but still lacking a focus.   Last night I remembered the date and it all   Began to grow together and take on purpose.    We sat up late while Deneb moved over the zenith   And I told Marie all about Boston, how it looked   That last terrible week, how hundreds stood weeping   Impotent in the streets that last midnight. I told her how those hours changed the lives of thousands, How America was forever a different place   Afterwards for many.                               In the morning We swam in the cold transparent lake, the blue   Damsel flies on all the reeds like millions   Of narrow metallic flowers, and I thought   Of you behind the grille in Dedham, Vanzetti, Saying, “Who would ever have thought we would make this history?” Crossing the brilliant mile-square meadow   Illuminated with asters and cyclamen,   The pollen of the lodgepole pines drifting   With the shifting wind over it and the blue   And sulphur butterflies drifting with the wind,   I saw you in the sour prison light, saying,   “Goodbye comrade.”                            In the basin under the crest Where the pines end and the Sierra primrose begins,   A party of lawyers was shooting at a whiskey bottle.   The bottle stayed on its rock, nobody could hit it. Looking back over the peaks and canyons from the last lake,   The pattern of human beings seemed simpler   Than the diagonals of water and stone.   Climbing the chute, up the melting snow and broken rock, I remembered what you said about Sacco, How it slipped your mind and you demanded it be read into the record. Traversing below the ragged arête, One cheek pressed against the rock The wind slapping the other, I saw you both marching in an army You with the red and black flag, Sacco with the rattlesnake banner. I kicked steps up the last snow bank and came   To the indescribably blue and fragrant Polemonium and the dead sky and the sterile Crystalline granite and final monolith of the summit.   These are the things that will last a long time, Vanzetti, I am glad that once on your day I have stood among them.   Some day mountains will be named after you and Sacco.   They will be here and your name with them, “When these days are but a dim remembering of the time   When man was wolf to man.” I think men will be remembering you a long time   Standing on the mountains Many men, a long time, comrade.\n	'1937':6 '22':5 'afterward':107 'america':101 'among':383 'armi':316 'arêt':297 'aster':165 'august':4 'back':238 'bank':336 'banner':328 'basin':204 'be':252 'began':46 'begin':216 'behind':139 'black':322 'blue':121,183,342 'boston':70 'bottl':226,228 'brilliant':158 'broken':270 'butterfli':186 'came':338 'canyon':243 'chang':95 'cheek':299 'chute':264 'climb':1,262 'cold':117 'comrad':201,440 'could':234 'crest':207 'cross':156 'crystallin':353 'cyclamen':167 'damsel':122 'date':42 'day':379,386,406 'dead':348 'dedham':143 'demand':286 'deneb':59 'detail':23 'diagon':257 'differ':105 'dim':410 'drift':174,187 'end':211 'ever':148 'final':356 'flag':323 'fli':123 'flower':133 'focus':36 'forev':103 'fragrant':344 'gather':19 'glad':374 'goodby':200 'granit':354 'grill':141 'grow':48 'histori':155 'hit':235 'hour':94 'human':251 'hundr':79 'illumin':163 'impot':82 'indescrib':341 'kick':330 'lack':34 'lake':119,247 'last':37,75,87,246,334,367 'late':57 'lawyer':220 'light':198 'like':128 'live':97 'lodgepol':172 'long':369,429,438 'look':73,237 'make':153 'man':416,420 'mani':109,435 'march':313 'mari':67 'meadow':162 'melt':267 'men':423,436 'metal':132 'midnight':88 'mile':160 'mile-squar':159 'mileston':2 'million':129 'mind':22,283 'monolith':357 'month':9 'morn':112 'mountain':3,387,434 'move':60 'name':390,401 'narrow':131 'night':38 'nobodi':233 'one':298 'parti':218 'pattern':249 'peak':241 'pine':173,210 'place':106 'poem':16,30 'polemonium':345 'pollen':169 'press':300 'primros':215 'prison':197 'purpos':53 'rag':296 'rattlesnak':327 'read':289 'record':292 'red':320 'reed':127 'rememb':40,273,411,426 'rhythm':27 'rock':232,271,303 'sacco':278,324,394 'said':276 'sat':55 'saw':192,310 'say':145,199 'seem':253 'shift':177 'shoot':222 'sierra':14,214 'signific':25 'simpler':254 'sky':349 'slap':306 'slip':281 'snow':268,335 'sour':196 'squar':161 'stand':431 'stay':229 'step':331 'steril':352 'still':33 'stone':261 'stood':80,382 'street':85 'sulphur':185 'summit':360 'swam':114 'take':51 'terribl':76 'thing':364 'think':422 'thought':136,150 'thousand':99 'time':370,414,430,439 'togeth':49 'told':66,90 'transpar':118 'travers':293 'vanzetti':144,371 'wander':11 'water':259 'way':29 'week':77 'weep':81 'whiskey':225 'wind':178,190,305 'wolf':418 'would':147,152 'zenith':63
911	Discrimination	318		\nI don’t mind the human race.   I’ve got pretty used to them   In these past twenty-five years.   I don’t mind if they sit next   To me on streetcars, or eat   In the same restaurants, if   It’s not at the same table.   However, I don’t approve   Of a woman I respect Dancing with one of them. I’ve   Tried asking them to my home   Without success. I shouldn’t   Care to see my own sister   Marry one.

912	Carentan O Carentan	319		\nTrees in the old days used to stand  And shape a shady lane Where lovers wandered hand in hand  Who came from Carentan. This was the shining green canal  Where we came two by two  Walking at combat-interval.  Such trees we never knew. The day was early June, the ground  Was soft and bright with dew.  Far away the guns did sound, But here the sky was blue. The sky was blue, but there a smoke  Hung still above the sea Where the ships together spoke  To towns we could not see. Could you have seen us through a glass  You would have said a walk  Of farmers out to turn the grass,  Each with his own hay-fork. The watchers in their leopard suits  Waited till it was time, And aimed between the belt and boot  And let the barrel climb. I must lie down at once, there is  A hammer at my knee. And call it death or cowardice,  Don’t count again on me. Everything’s all right, Mother,  Everyone gets the same  At one time or another.  It’s all in the game. I never strolled, nor ever shall,  Down such a leafy lane. I never drank in a canal, Nor ever shall again. There is a whistling in the leaves  And it is not the wind, The twigs are falling from the knives  That cut men to the ground. Tell me, Master-Sergeant,  The way to turn and shoot.  But the Sergeant’s silent  That taught me how to do it. O Captain, show us quickly  Our place upon the map.  But the Captain’s sickly And taking a long nap. Lieutenant, what’s my duty,  My place in the platoon? He too’s a sleeping beauty,  Charmed by that strange tune. Carentan O Carentan Before we met with you We never yet had lost a man  Or known what death could do.\n	'aim':138 'anoth':187 'away':63 'barrel':147 'beauti':299 'belt':141 'blue':73,77 'boot':143 'bright':59 'call':163 'came':24,35 'canal':32,210 'captain':265,276 'carentan':1,3,26,305,307 'charm':300 'climb':148 'combat':42 'combat-interv':41 'could':95,98,324 'count':170 'cowardic':167 'cut':236 'day':8,50 'death':165,323 'dew':61 'drank':207 'duti':288 'earli':52 'ever':198,212 'everyon':179 'everyth':174 'fall':231 'far':62 'farmer':113 'fork':125 'game':193 'get':180 'glass':105 'grass':118 'green':31 'ground':55,240 'gun':65 'hammer':158 'hand':20,22 'hay':124 'hay-fork':123 'hung':82 'interv':43 'june':53 'knee':161 'knew':48 'knive':234 'known':321 'lane':16,204 'leafi':203 'leav':221 'leopard':130 'let':145 'lie':151 'lieuten':284 'long':282 'lost':317 'lover':18 'man':319 'map':273 'master':244 'master-serg':243 'men':237 'met':310 'mother':178 'must':150 'nap':283 'never':47,195,206,314 'o':2,264,306 'old':7 'one':184 'place':270,290 'platoon':293 'quick':268 'right':177 'said':109 'sea':86 'see':97 'seen':101 'sergeant':245,254 'shadi':15 'shall':199,213 'shape':13 'shine':30 'ship':89 'shoot':251 'show':266 'sick':278 'silent':256 'sky':71,75 'sleep':298 'smoke':81 'soft':57 'sound':67 'spoke':91 'stand':11 'still':83 'strang':303 'stroll':196 'suit':131 'take':280 'taught':258 'tell':241 'till':133 'time':136,185 'togeth':90 'town':93 'tree':4,45 'tune':304 'turn':116,249 'twig':229 'two':36,38 'upon':271 'us':102,267 'use':9 'wait':132 'walk':39,111 'wander':19 'watcher':127 'way':247 'whistl':218 'wind':227 'would':107 'yet':315
913	I Dreamed That in a City Dark as Paris	319		\nI dreamed that in a city dark as Paris   I stood alone in a deserted square.   The night was trembling with a violet   Expectancy. At the far edge it moved   And rumbled; on that flickering horizon   The guns were pumping color in the sky. There was the Front. But I was lonely here,   Left behind, abandoned by the army.   The empty city and the empty square   Was my inhabitation, my unrest.   The helmet with its vestige of a crest,   The rifle in my hands, long out of date,   The belt I wore, the trailing overcoat   And hobnail boots, were those of a poilu.   I was the man, as awkward as a bear. Over the rooftops where cathedrals loomed   In speaking majesty, two aeroplanes Forlorn as birds, appeared. Then growing large,   The German Taube and the Nieuport Scout, They chased each other tumbling through the sky,   Till one streamed down on fire to the earth. These wars have been so great, they are forgotten   Like the Egyptian dynasts. My confrere   In whose thick boots I stood, were you amazed   To wander through my brain four decades later   As I have wandered in a dream through yours? The violence of waking life disrupts The order of our death. Strange dreams occur,   For dreams are licensed as they never were.\n	'abandon':65 'aeroplan':132 'alon':21 'amaz':187 'appear':136 'armi':68 'awkward':118 'bear':121 'behind':64 'belt':99 'bird':135 'boot':107,182 'brain':192 'cathedr':126 'chase':148 'citi':6,15,71 'color':50 'confrer':178 'crest':88 'dark':7,16 'date':97 'death':215 'decad':194 'desert':24 'disrupt':210 'dream':2,11,202,217,220 'dynast':176 'earth':163 'edg':37 'egyptian':175 'empti':70,74 'expect':33 'far':36 'fire':160 'flicker':44 'forgotten':172 'forlorn':133 'four':193 'front':57 'german':141 'great':169 'grow':138 'gun':47 'hand':93 'helmet':82 'hobnail':106 'horizon':45 'inhabit':78 'larg':139 'later':195 'left':63 'licens':222 'life':209 'like':173 'lone':61 'long':94 'loom':127 'majesti':130 'man':116 'move':39 'never':225 'nieuport':145 'night':27 'occur':218 'one':156 'order':212 'overcoat':104 'pari':9,18 'poilu':112 'pump':49 'rifl':90 'rooftop':124 'rumbl':41 'scout':146 'sky':53,154 'speak':129 'squar':25,75 'stood':20,184 'strang':216 'stream':157 'taub':142 'thick':181 'till':155 'trail':103 'trembl':29 'tumbl':151 'two':131 'unrest':80 'vestig':85 'violenc':206 'violet':32 'wake':208 'wander':189,199 'war':165 'whose':180 'wore':101

And in our early days we did the same.   Remembering our fathers in their wreck We crossed the sea from Palos where they came   And saw, enormous to the little deck,   A shore in silence waiting for a name.

915	My Father in the Night Commanding No	319		\nMy father in the night commanding No Has work to do. Smoke issues from his lips;         He reads in silence. The frogs are croaking and the street lamps glow. And then my mother winds the gramophone;   The Bride of Lammermoor begins to shriek—       Or reads a story— About a prince, a castle, and a dragon. The moon is glittering above the hill. I stand before the gateposts of the King—       So runs the story Of Thule, at midnight when the mice are still. And I have been in Thule! It has come true— The journey and the danger of the world,         All that there is To bear and to enjoy, endure and do. Landscapes, seascapes ... where have I been led?   The names of cities—Paris, Venice, Rome—       Held out their arms. A feathered god, seductive, went ahead. Here is my house. Under a red rose tree   A child is swinging; another gravely plays.         They are not surprised That I am here; they were expecting me. And yet my father sits and reads in silence,   My mother sheds a tear, the moon is still,         And the dark wind Is murmuring that nothing ever happens. Beyond his jurisdiction as I move Do I not prove him wrong? And yet, it’s true         They will not change There, on the stage of terror and of love. The actors in that playhouse always sit   In fixed positions—father, mother, child       With painted eyes. How sad it is to be a little puppet! Their heads are wooden. And you once pretended   To understand them! Shake them as you will,         They cannot speak. Do what you will, the comedy is ended. Father, why did you work? Why did you weep,   Mother? Was the story so important?       “Listen!” the wind Said to the children, and they fell asleep.\n	'actor':232 'ahead':144 'alway':236 'anoth':158 'arm':138 'asleep':308 'bear':114 'begin':48 'beyond':201 'bride':45 'cannot':273 'castl':59 'chang':221 'child':155,243 'children':304 'citi':131 'come':99 'comedi':280 'command':6,13 'croak':31 'danger':105 'dark':193 'dragon':62 'end':282 'endur':118 'enjoy':117 'ever':199 'expect':171 'eye':246 'father':2,9,176,241,283 'feather':140 'fell':307 'fix':239 'frog':29 'gatepost':74 'glitter':66 'glow':36 'god':141 'gramophon':43 'grave':159 'happen':200 'head':257 'held':135 'hill':69 'hous':148 'import':297 'issu':20 'journey':102 'jurisdict':203 'king':77 'lammermoor':47 'lamp':35 'landscap':121 'led':127 'lip':23 'listen':298 'littl':254 'love':230 'mice':88 'midnight':85 'moon':64,188 'mother':40,183,242,292 'move':206 'murmur':196 'name':129 'night':5,12 'noth':198 'paint':245 'pari':132 'play':160 'playhous':235 'posit':240 'pretend':263 'princ':57 'prove':210 'puppet':255 'read':25,52,179 'red':151 'rome':134 'rose':152 'run':79 'sad':248 'said':301 'seascap':122 'seduct':142 'shake':267 'shed':184 'shriek':50 'silenc':27,181 'sit':177,237 'smoke':19 'speak':274 'stage':225 'stand':71 'still':90,190 'stori':54,81,295 'street':34 'surpris':164 'swing':157 'tear':186 'terror':227 'thule':83,96 'tree':153 'true':100,217 'understand':265 'venic':133 'weep':291 'went':143 'wind':41,194,300 'wooden':259 'work':16,287 'world':108 'wrong':212 'yet':174,214

917	The Man Who Married Magdalene	319		\nThe man who married Magdalene  Had not forgiven her. God might pardon every sin ...  Love is no pardoner. Her hands were hollow, pale, and blue,  Her mouth like watered wine. He watched to see if she were true  And waited for a sign. It was old harlotry, he guessed,  That drained her strength away,  So gladly for the dark she dressed,  So sadly for the day. Their quarrels made her dull and weak  And soon a man might fit A penny in the hollow cheek And never notice it. At last, as they exhausted slept,  Death granted the divorce,  And nakedly the woman leapt  Upon that narrow horse. But when he woke and woke alone  He wept and would deny The loose behavior of the bone  And the immodest thigh.\n	'alon':120 'away':59 'behavior':128 'blue':30 'bone':131 'cheek':90 'dark':64 'day':71 'death':101 'deni':125 'divorc':104 'drain':56 'dress':66 'dull':76 'everi':18 'exhaust':99 'fit':84 'forgiven':13 'glad':61 'god':15 'grant':102 'guess':54 'hand':25 'harlotri':52 'hollow':27,89 'hors':113 'immodest':134 'last':96 'leapt':109 'like':33 'loos':127 'love':20 'made':74 'magdalen':5,10 'man':2,7,82 'marri':4,9 'might':16,83 'mouth':32 'nake':106 'narrow':112 'never':92 'notic':93 'old':51 'pale':28 'pardon':17,23 'penni':86 'quarrel':73 'sad':68 'see':39 'sign':48 'sin':19 'slept':100 'soon':80 'strength':58 'thigh':135 'true':43 'upon':110 'wait':45 'watch':37 'water':34 'weak':78 'wept':122 'wine':35 'woke':117,119 'woman':108 'would':124
918	After Midnight	319		\nThe dark streets are deserted,  With only a drugstore glowing  Softly, like a sleeping body; With one white, naked bulb  In the back, that shines  On suicides and abortions. Who lives in these dark houses?  I am suddenly aware  I might live here myself. The garage man returns And puts the change in my hand,  Counting the singles carefully.\n	'abort':31 'awar':41 'back':25 'bodi':17 'bulb':22 'care':61 'chang':54 'count':58 'dark':4,36 'desert':7 'drugstor':11 'garag':48 'glow':12 'hand':57 'hous':37 'like':14 'live':33,44 'man':49 'midnight':2 'might':43 'nake':21 'one':19 'put':52 'return':50 'shine':27 'singl':60 'sleep':16 'soft':13 'street':5 'sudden':40 'suicid':29 'white':20
919	Sway	319		\nEveryone at Lake Kearney had a nickname:  there was a Bumstead, a Tonto, a Tex,  and, from the slogan of a popular orchestra,  two sisters, Swing and Sway. Swing jitterbugged, hopping around on the dance floor, working up a sweat. Sway was beautiful. My heart went out to her  when she lifted her heavy rack of dishes  and passed through the swinging door. She was engaged, to an enlisted man  who was stationed at Fort Dix. He came once or twice on weekends to see her. I tried talking to him, but he didn’t answer ... out of stupidity  or dislike, I could not tell which. In real life he was a furniture salesman.  This was the hero on whom she had chosen  to bestow her affections. I told her of my ambition: to write novels conveying the excitement  of life ... the main building lit up like a liner on Saturday night; the sound of the band ... clarinet,  saxophone, snare drum, piano. He who would know your heart (America)  must seek it in your songs. And the contents of your purse ...  among Kleenex, aspirin,  chewing gum wrappers, combs, et cetera. “Don’t stop,” she said, “I’m listening.  Here it is!” flourishing her lighter.          * In the afternoon when the dishes were washed  and tables wiped, we rowed out on the lake.  I read aloud ... The Duino Elegies, while she reclined, one shapely knee up,  trailing a hand in the water. She had chestnut-colored hair. Her eyes were changing like the surface  with ripples and the shadows of clouds. “Beauty,” I read to her, “is nothing but beginning of Terror we’re still just able to bear.”          * She came from Jersey, the industrial wasteland  behind which Manhattan suddenly rises.  I could visualize the street where she lived,  and see her muffled against the cold,  in galoshes, trudging to school.  Running about in tennis shoes  all through the summer ...  I could hear the porch swing squeak  and see into the parlor. It was divided by a curtain or screen ...  “That’s it,” she said, “all but the screen.  There isn’t any.” When she or her sister had a boyfriend  their mother used to stay in the parlor,  pretending to sew, and keeping an eye on them  like Fate. At night she would lie awake looking at the sky, spangled over. Her thoughts were as deep and wide as the sky.  As time went by she had a feeling of missing out ... that everything was happening somewhere else. Some of the kids she grew up with went crazy ... like a car turning over and over. One of her friends had been beaten  by the police. Some vital fluid  seemed to have gone out of him. His arms and legs shook. Busted springs.          * She said, “When you’re a famous novelist  will you write about me?” I promised ... and tried to keep my promise. Recently, looking for a toolbox, I came upon some typewritten pages, all about her. There she is in a canoe ... a gust of wind rustling the leaves along the shore. Playing tennis, running up and down the baseline.  Down by the boathouse, listening to the orchestra  playing “Sleepy Lagoon.” Then the trouble begins. I can never think of anything  to make the characters do. We are still sitting in the moonlight while she finishes her cigarette. Two people go by, talking in low voices. A car door slams. Driving off ...  “I suppose we ought to go,”  I say.                    And she says, “Not yet.”\n	'abl':277 'affect':128 'afternoon':208 'along':512 'aloud':225 'ambit':134 'america':170 'among':183 'answer':97 'anyth':543 'arm':458 'around':33 'aspirin':185 'awak':386 'band':158 'baselin':522 'bear':279 'beaten':443 'beauti':44,262 'begin':270,537 'behind':287 'bestow':126 'boathous':526 'boyfriend':361 'build':145 'bumstead':12 'bust':462 'came':79,281,491 'cano':504 'car':432,570 'cetera':191 'chang':251 'charact':547 'chestnut':245 'chestnut-color':244 'chew':186 'chosen':124 'cigarett':560 'clarinet':159 'cloud':261 'cold':306 'color':246 'comb':189 'content':179 'convey':138 'could':104,293,322 'crazi':429 'curtain':338 'danc':36 'deep':397 'didn':95 'dish':58,211 'dislik':102 'divid':335 'dix':77 'door':64,571 'drive':573 'drum':162 'duino':227 'elegi':228 'els':419 'engag':67 'enlist':70 'et':190 'everyon':2 'everyth':415 'excit':140 'eye':249,376 'famous':470 'fate':380 'feel':410 'finish':558 'floor':37 'flourish':203 'fluid':449 'fort':76 'friend':440 'furnitur':114 'galosh':308 'go':563,580 'gone':453 'grew':425 'gum':187 'gust':506 'hair':247 'hand':238 'happen':417 'hear':323 'heart':46,169 'heavi':55 'hero':119 'hop':32 'industri':285 'isn':351 'jersey':283 'jitterbug':31 'kearney':5 'keep':374,482 'kid':423 'kleenex':184 'knee':234 'know':167 'lagoon':533 'lake':4,222 'leav':511 'leg':460 'lie':385 'life':110,142 'lift':53 'lighter':205 'like':148,252,379,430 'liner':150 'listen':199,527 'lit':146 'live':299 'look':387,486 'low':567 'm':198 'main':144 'make':545 'man':71 'manhattan':289 'miss':412 'moonlight':555 'mother':363 'muffl':303 'must':171 'never':540 'nicknam':8 'night':153,382 'noth':268 'novel':137 'novelist':471 'one':232,437 'orchestra':24,530 'ought':578 'page':495 'parlor':332,369 'pass':60 'peopl':562 'piano':163 'play':515,531 'polic':446 'popular':23 'porch':325 'pretend':370 'promis':478,484 'purs':182 'rack':56 're':274,468 'read':224,264 'real':109 'recent':485 'reclin':231 'rippl':256 'rise':291 'row':218 'run':312,517 'rustl':509 'said':196,345,465 'salesman':115 'saturday':152 'saxophon':160 'say':582,585 'school':311 'screen':340,349 'see':86,301,329 'seek':172 'seem':450 'sew':372 'shadow':259 'shape':233 'shoe':316 'shook':461 'shore':514 'sister':26,358 'sit':552 'sky':390,402 'slam':572 'sleepi':532 'slogan':20 'snare':161 'somewher':418 'song':176 'sound':155 'spangl':391 'spring':463 'squeak':327 'station':74 'stay':366 'still':275,551 'stop':194 'street':296 'stupid':100 'sudden':290 'summer':320 'suppos':576 'surfac':254 'sway':1,29,42 'sweat':41 'swing':27,30,63,326 'tabl':215 'talk':90,565 'tell':106 'tenni':315,516 'terror':272 'tex':16 'think':541 'thought':394 'time':404 'told':130 'tonto':14 'toolbox':489 'trail':236 'tri':89,480 'troubl':536 'trudg':309 'turn':433 'twice':82 'two':25,561 'typewritten':494 'upon':492 'use':364 'visual':294 'vital':448 'voic':568 'wash':213 'wasteland':286 'water':241 'weekend':84 'went':47,405,428 'wide':399 'wind':508 'wipe':216 'work':38 'would':166,384 'wrapper':188 'write':136,474 'yet':587
920	Vandergast and the Girl	319		\nVandergast to his neighbors— the grinding of a garage door and hiss of gravel in the driveway. He worked for the insurance company  whose talisman is a phoenix rising in flames ... non omnis moriar. From his desk he had a view of the street— translucent raincoats, and umbrellas,  fluorescent plate-glass windows.  A girl knelt down, arranging underwear on a female dummy— sea waves and, on the gale,  Venus, these busy days, poised in her garter belt and stockings.          * The next day he saw her eating in the restaurant where he usually ate. Soon they were having lunch together  elsewhere.                 She came from Dallas. This was only a start, she was ambitious,  twenty-five and still unmarried. Green eyes with silver spiricles ... red hair ...                   When he held the car door open  her legs were smooth and slender. “I was wondering,” she said, “when you'd get round to it,”  and laughed.          * Vandergast says he never intended  having an affair.                            And was that what this was?  The names that people give to things ... What do definitions and divorce-court proceedings  have to do with the breathless reality? O little lamp at the bedside with views of Venice and the Bay of Naples,  you understood! Lactona toothbrush and suitcase bought in a hurry, you were the witnesses of the love we made in bed together. Schrafft's Chocolate Cherries, surely you remember  when she said she'd be true forever, and, watching “Dark Storm,” we decided  there is something to be said, after all, for soap opera, “if it makes people happy.”          * The Vandergasts are having some trouble  finding a buyer for their house. When I go for a walk with Tippy  I pass the unweeded tennis court, the empty garage, windows heavily shuttered. Mrs. Vandergast took the children  and went back to her family. And Vandergast moved to New Jersey,  where he works for an insurance company  whose emblem is the Rock of Gibraltar— the rest of his life laid out with the child-support and alimony payments. As for the girl, she vanished. Was it worth it? Ask Vandergast. You'd have to be Vandergast, looking through his eyes  at the house across the street, in Orange, New Jersey.  Maybe on wet days umbrellas and raincoats set his heart thudding.                                   Maybe he talks to his pillow, and it whispers,  moving red hair. In any case, he will soon be forty. \n	'across':371 'affair':165 'alimoni':344 'ambiti':117 'arrang':62 'ask':356 'ate':98 'back':307 'bay':206 'bed':229 'bedsid':199 'belt':82 'bought':215 'breathless':192 'busi':76 'buyer':276 'came':107 'car':135 'case':403 'cherri':234 'child':341 'child-support':340 'children':304 'chocol':233 'compani':27,323 'court':185,293 'd':151,242,359 'dalla':109 'dark':248 'day':77,87,381 'decid':251 'definit':181 'desk':41 'divorc':184 'divorce-court':183 'door':14,136 'driveway':21 'dummi':67 'eat':91 'elsewher':105 'emblem':325 'empti':295 'eye':125,367 'famili':310 'femal':66 'find':274 'five':120 'flame':35 'fluoresc':53 'forev':245 'forti':408 'gale':73 'garag':13,296 'garter':81 'get':152 'gibraltar':330 'girl':4,59,349 'give':176 'glass':56 'go':282 'gravel':18 'green':124 'grind':10 'hair':130,400 'happi':267 'heart':387 'heavili':298 'held':133 'hiss':16 'hous':279,370 'hurri':218 'insur':26,322 'intend':162 'jersey':316,377 'knelt':60 'lactona':211 'laid':336 'lamp':196 'laugh':157 'leg':139 'life':335 'littl':195 'look':364 'love':225 'lunch':103 'made':227 'make':265 'mayb':378,389 'moriar':38 'move':313,398 'mrs':300 'name':173 'napl':208 'neighbor':8 'never':161 'new':315,376 'next':86 'non':36 'o':194 'omni':37 'open':137 'opera':262 'orang':375 'pass':289 'payment':345 'peopl':175,266 'phoenix':32 'pillow':394 'plate':55 'plate-glass':54 'pois':78 'proceed':186 'raincoat':50,384 'realiti':193 'red':129,399 'rememb':237 'rest':332 'restaur':94 'rise':33 'rock':328 'round':153 'said':148,240,257 'saw':89 'say':159 'schrafft':231 'sea':68 'set':385 'shutter':299 'silver':127 'slender':143 'smooth':141 'soap':261 'someth':254 'soon':99,406 'spiricl':128 'start':114 'still':122 'stock':84 'storm':249 'street':48,373 'suitcas':214 'support':342 'sure':235 'talisman':29 'talk':391 'tenni':292 'thing':178 'thud':388 'tippi':287 'togeth':104,230 'took':302 'toothbrush':212 'transluc':49 'troubl':273 'true':244 'twenti':119 'twenty-f':118 'umbrella':52,382 'understood':210 'underwear':63 'unmarri':123 'unweed':291 'usual':97 'vandergast':1,5,158,269,301,312,357,363 'vanish':351 'venic':203 'venus':74 'view':45,201 'walk':285 'watch':247 'wave':69 'went':306 'wet':380 'whisper':397 'whose':28,324 'window':57,297 'wit':222 'wonder':146 'work':23,319 'worth':354
921	There Is	319		\nLook! From my window there’s a view  of city streets where only lives as dry as tortoises  can crawl—the Gallapagos of desire. There is the day of Negroes with red hair and the day of insane women on the subway;  there is the day of the word Trieste and the night of the blind man with the electric guitar. But I have no profession. Like a spy I read the papers—Situations Wanted.  Surely there is a secret which, if I knew it, would change everything! 2 I have the poor man’s nerve-tic, irony. I see through the illusions of the age! The bell tolls, and the hearse advances, and the mourners follow, for my entertainment. I tread the burning pavement, the streets where drunkards stretch  like photographs of civil death and trumpets strangle in electric shelves. The mannequins stare at me scornfully.  I know they are pretending all day to be in earnest. And can it be that love is an illusion? When darkness falls on the enormous street  the air is filled with Eros, whispering.  Eyes, mouths, contrive to meet in silence, fearing they may be prevented. 3 O businessmen like ruins,  bankers who are Bastilles, widows, sadder than the shores of lakes, then you were happy, when you still could tremble! But all night long my window sheds tears of light. I seek the word. The word is not forthcoming.  O syllables of light ...

922	Lines Written Near San Francisco	319		\nI wake and feel the city trembling. Yes, there is something unsettled in the air   And the earth is uncertain. And so it was for the tenor Caruso. He couldn’t sleep—you know how the ovation   Rings in your ears, and you re-sing your part. And then the ceiling trembled And the floor moved. He ran into the street.   Never had Naples given him such a reception! The air was darker than Vesuvius.   “O mamma mia,” He cried, “I’ve lost my voice!” At that moment the hideous voice of Culture,   Hysterical woman, thrashing her arms and legs,   Shrieked from the ruins. At that moment everyone became a performer.   Otello and Don Giovanni   And Figaro strode on the midmost stage. In the high window of a burning castle   Lucia raved. Black horses Plunged through fire, dragging the wild bells. The curtains were wrapped in smoke. Tin swords   Were melting; masks and ruffs Burned—and the costumes of the peasants’ chorus. Night fell. The white moon rose   And sank in the Pacific. The tremors   Passed under the waves. And Death rested. 2 Now, as we stand idle, Watching the silent, bowler-hatted man, The engineer, who writes in the smoking field; Now as he hands the paper to a boy, Who takes it and runs to a group of waiting men,   And they disperse and move toward their wagons, Mules bray and the wagons move— Wait! Before you start (Already the wheels are rattling on the stones) Say, did your fathers cross the dry Sierras   To build another London? Do Americans always have to be second-rate? Wait! For there are spirits In the earth itself, or the air, or sea.   Where are the aboriginal American devils? Cloud shadows, pine shadows Falling across the bright Pacific bay ...    (Already they have nailed rough boards together) Wait only for the wind That rustles in the eucalyptus tree.   Wait only for the light That trembles on the petals of a rose. (The mortar sets—banks are the first to stand)   Wait for a rose, and you may wait forever. The silent man mops his head and drinks   Cold lemonade. “San Francisco   Is a city second only to Paris.” 3 Every night, at the end of America We taste our wine, looking at the Pacific.   How sad it is, the end of America! While we were waiting for the land   They’d finished it—with gas drums On the hilltops, cheap housing in the valleys Where lives are mean and wretched.   But the banks thrive and the realtors   Rejoice—they have their America. Still, there is something unsettled in the air.   Out there on the Pacific   There’s no America but the Marines. Whitman was wrong about the People, But right about himself. The land is within. At the end of the open road we come to ourselves. Though mad Columbus follows the sun   Into the sea, we cannot follow. We must remain, to serve the returning sun, And to set tables for death. For we are the colonists of Death— Not, as some think, of the English. And we are preparing thrones for him to sit,   Poems to read, and beds   In which it may please him to rest. This is the land The pioneers looked for, shading their eyes   Against the sun—a murmur of serious life.\n	'2':189 '3':375 'aborigin':294 'across':302 'air':20,77,288,446 'alreadi':248,307 'alway':270 'america':382,398,438,455 'american':269,295 'anoth':266 'arm':104 'bank':341,429 'bay':306 'becam':115 'bed':537 'bell':147 'black':139 'board':312 'bowler':199 'bowler-hat':198 'boy':218 'bray':239 'bright':304 'build':265 'burn':135,161 'cannot':494 'caruso':33 'castl':136 'ceil':57 'cheap':416 'chorus':168 'citi':11,370 'cloud':297 'cold':364 'colonist':514 'columbus':486 'come':481 'costum':164 'couldn':35 'cri':86 'cross':260 'cultur':99 'curtain':149 'd':407 'darker':79 'death':187,509,516 'devil':296 'dispers':232 'drag':144 'dri':262 'drink':363 'drum':412 'ear':46 'earth':23,284 'end':380,396,475 'engin':203 'english':523 'eucalyptus':323 'everi':376 'everyon':114 'eye':556 'fall':301 'father':259 'feel':9 'fell':170 'field':209 'figaro':123 'finish':408 'fire':143 'first':344 'floor':61 'follow':487,495 'forev':355 'francisco':5,367 'gas':411 'giovanni':121 'given':71 'group':226 'hand':213 'hat':200 'head':361 'hideous':96 'high':131 'hilltop':415 'hors':140 'hous':417 'hyster':100 'idl':194 'know':39 'land':405,470,549 'leg':106 'lemonad':365 'life':564 'light':329 'line':1 'live':422 'london':267 'look':387,552 'lost':89 'lucia':137 'mad':485 'mamma':83 'man':201,358 'marin':458 'mask':158 'may':353,541 'mean':424 'melt':157 'men':229 'mia':84 'midmost':127 'moment':94,113 'moon':173 'mop':359 'mortar':339 'move':62,234,243 'mule':238 'murmur':561 'must':497 'nail':310 'napl':70 'near':3 'never':68 'night':169,377 'o':82 'open':478 'otello':118 'ovat':42 'pacif':179,305,390,451 'paper':215 'pari':374 'part':53 'pass':182 'peasant':167 'peopl':464 'perform':117 'petal':334 'pine':299 'pioneer':551 'pleas':542 'plung':141 'poem':533 'prepar':527 'ran':64 'rate':276 'rattl':252 'rave':138 're':50 're-s':49 'read':535 'realtor':433 'recept':75 'rejoic':434 'remain':498 'rest':188,545 'return':502 'right':466 'ring':43 'road':479 'rose':174,337,350 'rough':311 'ruff':160 'ruin':110 'run':223 'rustl':320 'sad':392 'san':4,366 'sank':176 'say':256 'sea':290,492 'second':275,371 'second-r':274 'serious':563 'serv':500 'set':340,506 'shade':554 'shadow':298,300 'shriek':107 'sierra':263 'silent':197,357 'sing':51 'sit':532 'sleep':37 'smoke':153,208 'someth':16,442 'spirit':281 'stage':128 'stand':193,346 'start':247 'still':439 'stone':255 'street':67 'strode':124 'sun':489,503,559 'sword':155 'tabl':507 'take':220 'tast':384 'tenor':32 'think':520 'though':484 'thrash':102 'thrive':430 'throne':528 'tin':154 'togeth':313 'toward':235 'tree':324 'trembl':12,58,331 'tremor':181 'uncertain':25 'unsettl':17,443 'valley':420 've':88 'vesuvius':81 'voic':91,97 'wagon':237,242 'wait':228,244,277,314,325,347,354,402 'wake':7 'watch':195 'wave':185 'wheel':250 'white':172 'whitman':459 'wild':146 'wind':318 'window':132 'wine':386 'within':472 'woman':101 'wrap':151 'wretch':426 'write':205 'written':2 'wrong':461 'yes':13
923	from The Laurel Tree	319		\nIn the clear light that confuses everything   Only you, dark laurel,   Shadow my house, Lifting your arms in the anguish   Of nature at the stake. And at night, quivering with tears, You are like the tree called Tasso’s.   Crippled, and hooped with iron,   It stands on Peter’s hill. When the lovers prop their bicycles   And sit on the high benches   That look across to eternity, That tree makes their own torsion Seem natural. And so, they’re comforted. 2 One of the local philosophers ...   He says, “In California We have the old anarchist tradition.” What can he mean? Is there an anarchist tradition?   And why would an anarchist want one?   O California, Is there a tree without opinions?   Come, let me clasp you!   Let me feel the idea breathing. I too cry O for a life of sensations   Rather than thoughts— “The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall.” Like the girls in our neighborhood,   They’re beautiful and silent. 3 As I was digging in the back yard   I thought of a man in China. A lifetime, it seemed, we gazed at each other. I could see and hear his heartbeats   Like a spade hurling clods. He pointed behind him, and I saw That the hills were covered with armed men,   And they were all on the other side   Of the life that I held dear. He said, “We are as various   As the twigs of a tree, But now the tree moves as one man. It walks. And the earth trembles   When a race of slaves is leaving.” 4 I said, “Yet, all these people   Will fall down as one man When the entrails of a bomb are breathing. When we came down from Chosin   Carrying the guns in dainty snow-wear   And all the dead we had to, It was a time of forgetfulness,   Like a plucked string.   It was a river of darkness. Was it not so on your side, when you came   To the sea that was covered with ships?   Let us speak to each other, Let the word rise, making dark strokes in the air.   That bird flies over the heads of the armed men.” 5 One part of the tree grows outward.   The other I saw when, with a light, I explored the cellar—shattering roots. They had broken through the wall, As though there were something in my rubbish   That life would have at last. I must be patient with shapes Of automobile fenders and ketchup bottles.   These things are the beginning Of things not visible to the naked eye.   It was so in the time of Tobit— The dish glowed when the angel held it. It is so that spiritual messengers   Deliver their meaning.\n	'2':85 '3':167 '4':267 '5':369 'across':69 'air':358 'anarchist':99,108,114 'angel':449 'anguish':24 'arm':21,217,367 'automobil':418 'back':174 'beauti':164 'begin':427 'behind':206 'bench':66 'bicycl':60 'bird':360 'bomb':285 'bottl':422 'breath':135,287 'broken':393 'california':94,118 'call':41 'came':290,334 'carri':294 'cedar':152 'cellar':388 'china':182 'chosin':293 'clasp':128 'clear':7 'clod':203 'come':125 'comfort':84 'confus':10 'could':193 'cover':215,340 'cri':138 'crippl':44 'dainti':298 'dark':14,324,354 'dead':305 'dear':233 'deliv':458 'dig':171 'dish':445 'earth':258 'entrail':282 'etern':71 'everyth':11 'explor':386 'eye':435 'fall':275 'feel':132 'fender':419 'fli':361 'forget':314 'gaze':188 'girl':158 'glow':446 'grow':375 'gun':296 'head':364 'hear':196 'heartbeat':198 'held':232,450 'high':65 'hill':54,213 'hoop':46 'hous':18 'hurl':202 'idea':134 'iron':48 'ketchup':421 'last':410 'laurel':3,15 'leav':266 'let':126,130,343,349 'life':142,229,406 'lifetim':184 'lift':19 'light':8,384 'like':38,156,199,315 'local':89 'look':68 'lover':57 'make':74,353 'man':180,253,279 'mean':104,460 'men':218,368 'messeng':457 'move':250 'must':412 'nake':434 'natur':26,79 'neighborhood':161 'night':32 'o':117,139 'old':98 'one':86,116,252,278,370 'opinion':124 'outward':376 'part':371 'patient':414 'peopl':273 'peter':52 'philosoph':90 'pine':150 'pluck':317 'point':205 'prop':58 'proud':153 'quiver':33 'race':262 'rather':145 're':83,163 'rise':352 'river':322 'root':390 'rubbish':404 'said':235,269 'saw':210,380 'say':92 'sayl':149 'sea':337 'see':194 'seem':78,186 'sensat':144 'shadow':16 'shape':416 'shatter':389 'ship':342 'side':226,331 'silent':166 'sit':62 'slave':264 'snow':300 'snow-wear':299 'someth':401 'spade':201 'speak':345 'spiritu':456 'stake':29 'stand':50 'string':318 'stroke':355 'tall':155 'tasso':42 'tear':35 'thing':424,429 'though':398 'thought':147,177 'time':312,441 'tobit':443 'torsion':77 'tradit':100,109 'tree':4,40,73,122,245,249,374 'trembl':259 'twig':242 'us':344 'various':239 'visibl':431 'walk':255 'wall':396 'want':115 'wear':301 'without':123 'word':351 'would':112,407 'yard':175 'yet':270
924	Things	319		\nA man stood in the laurel tree Adjusting his hands and feet to the boughs.  He said, “Today I was breaking stones  On a mountain road in Asia, When suddenly I had a vision Of mankind, like grass and flowers,  The same over all the earth. We forgave each other; we gave ourselves  Wholly over to words. And straightway I was released  And sprang through an open gate.” I said, “Into a meadow?” He said, “I am impervious to irony.  I thank you for the word ...  I am standing in a sunlit meadow.  Know that everything your senses reject  Springs up in the spiritual world.” I said, “Our scientists have another opinion.  They say, you are merely phenomena.” He said, “Over here they will be angels  Singing, Holy holy be His Name! And also, it works in reverse. Things which to us in the pure state are mysterious,  Are your simplest articles of household use— A chair, a dish, and meaner even than these,  The very latest inventions. Machines are the animals of the Americans— Tell me about machines.” I said, “I have suspected The Mixmaster knows more than I do,  The air conditioner is the better poet. My right front tire is as bald as Odysseus— How much it must have suffered! Then, as things have a third substance  Which is obscure to both our senses, Let there be a perpetual coming and going  Between your house and mine.”\n	'adjust':9 'air':194 'also':135 'american':176 'angel':127 'anim':173 'anoth':112 'articl':153 'asia':29 'bald':206 'better':198 'bough':16 'break':22 'chair':158 'come':234 'condition':195 'dish':160 'earth':47 'even':163 'everyth':97 'feet':13 'flower':41 'forgav':49 'front':202 'gate':69 'gave':53 'go':236 'grass':39 'hand':11 'holi':129,130 'hous':239 'household':155 'impervi':79 'invent':169 'ironi':81 'know':95,188 'latest':168 'laurel':7 'let':229 'like':38 'machin':170,180 'man':3 'mankind':37 'meadow':74,94 'meaner':162 'mere':118 'mine':241 'mixmast':187 'mountain':26 'much':210 'must':212 'mysteri':149 'name':133 'obscur':224 'odysseus':208 'open':68 'opinion':113 'perpetu':233 'phenomena':119 'poet':199 'pure':146 'reject':100 'releas':63 'revers':139 'right':201 'road':27 'said':18,71,76,108,121,182 'say':115 'scientist':110 'sens':99,228 'simplest':152 'sing':128 'spiritu':105 'sprang':65 'spring':101 'stand':90 'state':147 'stone':23 'stood':4 'straightway':60 'substanc':221 'sudden':31 'suffer':214 'sunlit':93 'suspect':185 'tell':177 'thank':83 'thing':1,140,217 'third':220 'tire':203 'today':19 'tree':8 'us':143 'use':156 'vision':35 'wholli':55 'word':58,87 'work':137 'world':106

They are on the steep road  that goes up the mountain.  Their neat-stepping hoofs  appear to be flickering  in the sun, raising dust. They are higher than the roofs on which striped gourds and melons  lie ripening. They move among the dark green olives that grow on the rocks. they dwindle as they climb ...  vanish around a corner and reappear walking on the edge  of a precipice.

927	Grandfather	292		\nIn 1915 my grandfather’s neighbors surrounded his house near the dayline he ran on the Hudson in Catskill, NY and thought they’d burn his family out in a movie they’d just seen and be rid of his kind: the death of a lone black family is the Birth of a Nation, or so they thought. His 5’4” waiter gait quenched the white jacket smile he’d brought back from watered polish of my father on the turning seats, and he asked his neighbors up on his thatched porch for the first blossom of fire that would bring him down. They went away, his nation, spittooning their torched necks in the shadows of the riverboat they’d seen, posse decomposing; and I see him on Sutter with white bag from your restaurant, challenged by his first grandson to a foot-race he will win in white clothes. I see him as he buys galoshes for his railed yard near Mineo’s metal shop, where roses jump as the el circles his house toward Brooklyn, where his rain fell; and I see cigar smoke in his eyes, chocolate Madison Square Garden chews he breaks on his set teeth, stitched up after cancer, the great white nation immovable as his weight wilts and he is on a porch that won’t hold my arms, or the legs of the race run forwards, or the film played backwards on his grandson’s eyes.\n	'1915':3 '4':62 '5':61 'arm':227 'ask':86 'away':107 'back':73 'backward':240 'bag':133 'birth':52 'black':48 'blossom':97 'break':198 'bring':102 'brooklyn':179 'brought':72 'burn':26 'buy':158 'cancer':206 'catskil':20 'challeng':137 'chew':196 'chocol':192 'cigar':187 'circl':175 'cloth':152 'd':25,34,71,121 'daylin':13 'death':44 'decompos':124 'el':174 'eye':191,245 'famili':28,49 'father':79 'fell':183 'film':238 'fire':99 'first':96,140 'foot':145 'foot-rac':144 'forward':235 'gait':64 'galosh':159 'garden':195 'grandfath':1,5 'grandson':141,243 'great':208 'hold':225 'hous':10,177 'hudson':18 'immov':211 'jacket':68 'jump':171 'kind':42 'leg':230 'lone':47 'madison':193 'metal':167 'mineo':165 'movi':32 'nation':55,109,210 'near':11,164 'neck':113 'neighbor':7,88 'ny':21 'play':239 'polish':76 'porch':93,221 'poss':123 'quench':65 'race':146,233 'rail':162 'rain':182 'ran':15 'restaur':136 'rid':39 'riverboat':119 'rose':170 'run':234 'seat':83 'see':127,154,186 'seen':36,122 'set':201 'shadow':116 'shop':168 'smile':69 'smoke':188 'spittoon':110 'squar':194 'stitch':203 'surround':8 'sutter':130 'teeth':202 'thatch':92 'thought':23,59 'torch':112 'toward':178 'turn':82 'waiter':63 'water':75 'weight':214 'went':106 'white':67,132,151,209 'wilt':215 'win':149 'won':223 'would':101 'yard':163

Frowning   drunk waving moving a hand or lash.   Dancing kneeling reaching out, letting   a hand rest in shadows. Squatting   to drink or pee.

930	Incident	320		\nHe came back and shot. He shot him. When he came   back, he shot, and he fell, stumbling, past the   shadow wood, down, shot, dying, dead, to full halt. At the bottom, bleeding, shot dead. He died then, there   after the fall, the speeding bullet, tore his face   and blood sprayed fine over the killer and the grey light. Pictures of the dead man, are everywhere. And his spirit   sucks up the light. But he died in darkness darker than   his soul and everything tumbled blindly with him dying down the stairs.   We have no word on the killer, except he came back, from somewhere   to do what he did. And shot only once into his victim's stare, and left him quickly when the blood ran out. We know the killer was skillful, quick, and silent, and that the victim   probably knew him. Other than that, aside from the caked sourness   of the dead man's expression, and the cool surprise in the fixture of his hands and fingers, we know nothing.\n	'asid':149 'back':4,13,104 'bleed':34 'blind':87 'blood':51,127 'bottom':33 'bullet':46 'cake':152 'came':3,12,103 'cool':162 'dark':79 'darker':80 'dead':27,36,64,156 'die':26,38,77,90 'everyth':85 'everywher':67 'except':101 'express':159 'face':49 'fall':43 'fell':18 'fine':53 'finger':171 'fixtur':166 'full':29 'grey':59 'halt':30 'hand':169 'incid':1 'killer':56,100,133 'knew':144 'know':131,173 'left':122 'light':60,74 'man':65,157 'noth':174 'past':20 'pictur':61 'probabl':143 'quick':124,136 'ran':128 'shadow':22 'shot':6,8,15,25,35,113 'silent':138 'skill':135 'somewher':106 'soul':83 'sour':153 'speed':45 'spirit':70 'spray':52 'stair':93 'stare':120 'stumbl':19 'suck':71 'surpris':163 'tore':47 'tumbl':86 'victim':118,142 'wood':23 'word':97

The big sky river rushes overhead,   bearing asteroids and mist, blind fish   and old space suits with skeletons inside.   On Earth, men celebrate their hairiness, and it is good, a way of letting life out of the box, uncapping the bottle to let the effervescence gush through the narrow, usually constricted neck. And now the crickets plug in their appliances   in unison, and then the fireflies flash dots and dashes in the grass, like punctuation   for the labyrinthine, untrue tales of sex   someone is telling in the dark, though no one really hears.

939	Afterimages	323		\nI However the image enters its force remains within my eyes rockstrewn caves where dragonfish evolve   wild for life, relentless and acquisitive   learning to survive where there is no food my eyes are always hungry and remembering however the image enters its force remains. A white woman stands bereft and empty a black boy hacked into a murderous lesson   recalled in me forever like a lurch of earth on the edge of sleep   etched into my visions food for dragonfish that learn to live upon whatever they must eat fused images beneath my pain.     II The Pearl River floods through the streets of Jackson   A Mississippi summer televised. Trapped houses kneel like sinners in the rain a white woman climbs from her roof to a passing boat   her fingers tarry for a moment on the chimney   now awash tearless and no longer young, she holds   a tattered baby's blanket in her arms. In a flickering afterimage of the nightmare rain   a microphone thrust up against her flat bewildered words           “we jest come from the bank yestiddy                      borrowing money to pay the income tax                      now everything's gone. I never knew                      it could be so hard.” Despair weighs down her voice like Pearl River mud   caked around the edges her pale eyes scanning the camera for help or explanation unanswered she shifts her search across the watered street, dry-eyed                      “hard, but not this hard.” Two tow-headed children hurl themselves against her   hanging upon her coat like mirrors until a man with ham-like hands pulls her aside   snarling “She ain't got nothing more to say!” and that lie hangs in his mouth like a shred of rotting meat.     III I inherited Jackson, Mississippi. For my majority it gave me Emmett Till   his 15 years puffed out like bruises   on plump boy-cheeks his only Mississippi summer whistling a 21 gun salute to Dixie as a white girl passed him in the street   and he was baptized my son forever   in the midnight waters of the Pearl. His broken body is the afterimage of my 21st year when I walked through a northern summer my eyes averted from each corner's photographies   newspapers protest posters magazines   Police Story, Confidential, True   the avid insistence of detail pretending insight or information the length of gash across the dead boy's loins his grieving mother's lamentation   the severed lips, how many burns   his gouged out eyes sewed shut upon the screaming covers   louder than life all over the veiled warning, the secret relish   of a black child's mutilated body   fingered by street-corner eyes   bruise upon livid bruise and wherever I looked that summer I learned to be at home with children's blood with savored violence with pictures of black broken flesh   used, crumpled, and discarded   lying amid the sidewalk refuse   like a raped woman's face. A black boy from Chicago whistled on the streets of Jackson, Mississippi testing what he'd been taught was a manly thing to do his teachers ripped his eyes out his sex his tongue and flung him to the Pearl weighted with stone in the name of white womanhood they took their aroused honor back to Jackson and celebrated in a whorehouse the double ritual of white manhood confirmed.     IV     “If earth and air and water do not judge them who are       we to refuse a crust of bread?”	'15':300 '21':317 '21st':353 'acquisit':23 'across':226,391 'afterimag':1,158,350 'ain':266 'air':559 'alway':35 'amid':476 'arm':154 'around':208 'arous':538 'asid':263 'avert':364 'avid':379 'awash':139 'babi':149 'back':540 'bank':177 'baptiz':334 'beneath':93 'bereft':50 'bewild':170 'black':54,431,468,487 'blanket':151 'blood':461 'boat':128 'bodi':347,435 'borrow':179 'boy':55,309,394,488 'boy-cheek':308 'bread':574 'broken':346,469 'bruis':305,442,445 'burn':407 'cake':207 'camera':216 'cave':14 'celebr':544 'cheek':310 'chicago':490 'child':432 'children':242,459 'chimney':137 'climb':121 'coat':250 'come':174 'confidenti':376 'confirm':554 'corner':367,440 'could':194 'cover':417 'crumpl':472 'crust':572 'd':501 'dead':393 'despair':198 'detail':382 'discard':474 'dixi':321 'doubl':549 'dragonfish':16,81 'dri':231 'dry-ey':230 'earth':69,557 'eat':90 'edg':72,210 'emmett':297 'empti':52 'enter':6,42 'etch':75 'everyth':187 'evolv':17 'explan':220 'eye':12,33,213,232,363,411,441,514 'face':485 'finger':130,436 'flat':169 'flesh':470 'flicker':157 'flood':100 'flung':521 'food':31,79 'forc':8,44 'forev':64,337 'fuse':91 'gash':390 'gave':295 'girl':325 'gone':189 'got':268 'goug':409 'griev':398 'gun':318 'hack':56 'ham':258 'ham-lik':257 'hand':260 'hang':247,276 'hard':197,233,237 'head':241 'help':218 'hold':146 'home':457 'honor':539 'hous':111 'howev':3,39 'hungri':36 'hurl':243 'ii':96 'iii':286 'imag':5,41,92 'incom':184 'inform':386 'inherit':288 'insight':384 'insist':380 'iv':555 'jackson':105,289,496,542 'jest':173 'judg':564 'kneel':112 'knew':192 'lament':401 'learn':24,83,453 'length':388 'lesson':60 'lie':275,475 'life':20,420 'like':65,113,203,251,259,280,304,480 'lip':404 'live':85 'livid':444 'loin':396 'longer':143 'look':449 'louder':418 'lurch':67 'magazin':373 'major':293 'man':255,506 'manhood':553 'mani':406 'meat':285 'microphon':164 'midnight':340 'mirror':252 'mississippi':107,290,313,497 'moment':134 'money':180 'mother':399 'mouth':279 'mud':206 'murder':59 'must':89 'mutil':434 'name':531 'never':191 'newspap':370 'nightmar':161 'northern':360 'noth':269 'pain':95 'pale':212 'pass':127,326 'pay':182 'pearl':98,204,344,525 'photographi':369 'pictur':466 'plump':307 'polic':374 'poster':372 'pretend':383 'protest':371 'puf':302 'pull':261 'rain':117,162 'rape':482 'recal':61 'refus':479,570 'relentless':21 'relish':428 'remain':9,45 'rememb':38 'rip':512 'ritual':550 'river':99,205 'rockstrewn':13 'roof':124 'rot':284 'salut':319 'savor':463 'say':272 'scan':214 'scream':416 'search':225 'secret':427 'sever':403 'sew':412 'sex':517 'shift':223 'shred':282 'shut':413 'sidewalk':478 'sinner':114 'sleep':74 'snarl':264 'son':336 'stand':49 'stone':528 'stori':375 'street':103,229,330,439,494 'street-corn':438 'summer':108,314,361,451 'surviv':26 'tarri':131 'tatter':148 'taught':503 'tax':185 'teacher':511 'tearless':140 'televis':109 'test':498 'thing':507 'thrust':165 'till':298 'tongu':519 'took':536 'tow':240 'tow-head':239 'trap':110 'true':377 'two':238 'unansw':221 'upon':86,248,414,443 'use':471 'veil':424 'violenc':464 'vision':78 'voic':202 'walk':357 'warn':425 'water':228,341,561 'weigh':199 'weight':526 'whatev':87 'wherev':447 'whistl':315,491 'white':47,119,324,533,552 'whorehous':547 'wild':18 'within':10 'woman':48,120,483 'womanhood':534 'word':171 'year':301,354 'yestiddi':178 'young':144

942	Beauty	322		\nWhen the medication she was taking caused tiny vessels in her face to break, leaving faint but permanent blue stitches in her cheeks,   my sister said she knew she would never be beautiful again. After all those years of watching her reflection in the mirror,   sucking in her stomach and standing straight,   she said it was a relief, being done with beauty, but I could see her pause inside that moment   as the knowledge spread across her face   with a fine distress, sucking the peach out of her lips, making her cute nose seem, for the first time,   a little knobby. I’m probably the only one in the whole world   who actually remembers the year in high school   she perfected the art of being a dumb blond, spending recess on the breezeway by the physics lab,   tossing her hair and laughing that canary trill   which was her specialty, while some football player named Johnny   with a pained expression in his eyes wrapped his thick finger over and over again   in the bedspring of one of those pale curls. Or how she spent the next decade of her life   auditioning a series of tall men, looking for just one with the kind of attention span she could count on. Then one day her time of prettiness   was over, done, finito, and all those other beautiful women   in the magazines and on the streets   just kept on being beautiful everywhere you looked, walking in that kind of elegant, disinterested trance in which you sense they always seem to have one hand   touching the secret place that keeps their beauty safe, inhaling and exhaling the perfume of it— It was spring. Season when the young   buttercups and daisies climb up on the   mulched bodies of their forebears   to wave their flags in the parade. My sister just stood still for thirty seconds,   amazed by what was happening, then shrugged and tossed her shaggy head   as if she was throwing something out, something she had carried a long ways, but had no use for anymore, now that it had no use for her. That, too, was beautiful.\n	'across':77 'actual':114 'alway':256 'amaz':312 'anymor':343 'art':124 'attent':205 'audit':191 'beauti':1,34,63,226,239,269,355 'bedspr':174 'blond':129 'blue':20 'bodi':293 'break':15 'breezeway':134 'buttercup':285 'canari':145 'carri':334 'caus':8 'cheek':24 'climb':288 'could':66,208 'count':209 'curl':180 'cute':93 'daisi':287 'day':213 'decad':187 'disinterest':249 'distress':83 'done':61,220 'dumb':128 'eleg':248 'everywher':240 'exhal':273 'express':160 'eye':163 'face':13,79 'faint':17 'fine':82 'finger':167 'finito':221 'first':98 'flag':300 'footbal':153 'forebear':296 'hair':141 'hand':261 'happen':316 'head':323 'high':119 'inhal':271 'insid':70 'johnni':156 'keep':267 'kept':236 'kind':203,246 'knew':29 'knobbi':102 'knowledg':75 'lab':138 'laugh':143 'leav':16 'life':190 'lip':90 'littl':101 'long':336 'look':197,242 'm':104 'magazin':230 'make':91 'medic':4 'men':196 'mirror':46 'moment':72 'mulch':292 'name':155 'never':32 'next':186 'nose':94 'one':108,176,200,212,260 'pain':159 'pale':179 'parad':303 'paus':69 'peach':86 'perfect':122 'perfum':275 'perman':19 'physic':137 'place':265 'player':154 'pretti':217 'probabl':105 'recess':131 'reflect':43 'relief':59 'rememb':115 'safe':270 'said':27,55 'school':120 'season':281 'second':311 'secret':264 'see':67 'seem':95,257 'sens':254 'seri':193 'shaggi':322 'shrug':318 'sister':26,305 'someth':329,331 'span':206 'specialti':150 'spend':130 'spent':184 'spread':76 'spring':280 'stand':52 'still':308 'stitch':21 'stomach':50 'stood':307 'straight':53 'street':234 'suck':47,84 'take':7 'tall':195 'thick':166 'thirti':310 'throw':328 'time':99,215 'tini':9 'toss':139,320 'touch':262 'tranc':250 'trill':146 'use':341,349 'vessel':10 'walk':243 'watch':41 'wave':298 'way':337 'whole':111 'women':227 'world':112 'would':31 'wrap':164 'year':39,117 'young':284

946	From This Height	322		\nCold wind comes out of the white hills and rubs itself against the walls of the condominium   with an esophogeal vowel sound, and a loneliness creeps into the conversation by the hot tub. We don’t deserve pleasure just as we don’t deserve pain, but it’s pure sorcery the way the feathers of warm mist   keep rising from the surface of the water to wrap themselves around a sculpted clavicle or wrist. It’s not just that we are on the eighth story of the world looking out through glass and steel with a clarity of vision in which imported coffee and a knowledge of French painting                                               are combined, but that we are atop a pyramid of all the facts that make this possible:   the furnace that heats the water,   the truck that hauled the fuel, the artery of highway blasted through the mountains, the heart attack of the previous owner,   the history of Western medicine   that failed to save him, the successful development of tourism, the snow white lotions that counteract the chemistry   of chlorine upon skin—our skin. Down inside history’s body, the slaves are still singing in the dark;   the roads continue to be built; the wind blows and the building grips itself   in anticipation of the next strong gust. So an enormous act of forgetting is required   simply to kiss someone or to open your mouth for the fork of high-calorie paté someone is raising to your lips, which, considering the price,   it would be a sin   not to enjoy.\n	'act':223 'anticip':214 'around':72 'arteri':143 'atop':119 'attack':152 'blast':146 'blow':207 'bodi':190 'build':210 'built':204 'calori':243 'chemistri':179 'chlorin':181 'clariti':100 'clavicl':75 'coffe':106 'cold':4 'combin':114 'come':6 'condominium':20 'consid':252 'continu':201 'convers':32 'counteract':177 'creep':29 'dark':198 'deserv':40,47 'develop':169 'eighth':87 'enjoy':262 'enorm':222 'esophog':23 'fact':125 'fail':163 'feather':57 'forget':225 'fork':239 'french':111 'fuel':141 'furnac':131 'glass':95 'grip':211 'gust':219 'haul':139 'heart':151 'heat':133 'height':3 'high':242 'high-calori':241 'highway':145 'hill':11 'histori':158,188 'hot':35 'import':105 'insid':187 'keep':61 'kiss':230 'knowledg':109 'lip':250 'loneli':28 'look':92 'lotion':175 'make':127 'medicin':161 'mist':60 'mountain':149 'mouth':236 'next':217 'open':234 'owner':156 'pain':48 'paint':112 'paté':244 'pleasur':41 'possibl':129 'previous':155 'price':254 'pure':52 'pyramid':121 'rais':247 'requir':227 'rise':62 'road':200 'rub':13 'save':165 'sculpt':74 'simpli':228 'sin':259 'sing':195 'skin':183,185 'slave':192 'snow':173 'someon':231,245 'sorceri':53 'sound':25 'steel':97 'still':194 'stori':88 'strong':218 'success':168 'surfac':65 'tourism':171 'truck':137 'tub':36 'upon':182 'vision':102 'vowel':24 'wall':17 'warm':59 'water':68,135 'way':55 'western':160 'white':10,174 'wind':5,206 'world':91 'would':256 'wrap':70 'wrist':77
947	Memory As a Hearing Aid	322		\nSomewhere, someone is asking a question, and I stand squinting at the classroom with one hand cupped behind my ear, trying to figure out where that voice is coming from. I might be already an old man, attempting to recall the night his hearing got misplaced, front-row-center at a battle of the bands, where a lot of leather-clad, second-rate musicians,   amped up to dinosaur proportions, test drove their equipment through our ears.   Each time the drummer threw a tantrum, the guitarist whirled and sprayed us with machine-gun riffs,   as if they wished that they could knock us quite literally dead. We called that fun in 1970, when we weren’t sure our lives were worth surviving. I’m here to tell you that they were,   and many of us did, despite ourselves,   though the road from there to here is paved with dead brain cells, parents shocked to silence, and squad cars painting the whole neighborhood   the quaking tint and texture of red jelly. Friends, we should have postmarks on our foreheads   to show where we have been; we should have pointed ears, or polka-dotted skin   to show what we were thinking when we hot-rodded over God’s front lawn,   and Death kept blinking. But here I stand, an average-looking man   staring at a room where someone blond in braids   with a beautiful belief in answers   is still asking questions. Through the silence in my dead ear,   I can almost hear the future whisper   to the past: it says that this is not a test   and everybody passes.\n	'1970':120 'aid':5 'almost':260 'alreadi':39 'amp':73 'answer':246 'ask':9,249 'attempt':43 'averag':229 'average-look':228 'band':61 'battl':58 'beauti':243 'behind':23 'belief':244 'blink':222 'blond':238 'braid':240 'brain':158 'call':116 'car':166 'cell':159 'center':55 'clad':68 'classroom':18 'come':34 'could':109 'cup':22 'dead':114,157,256 'death':220 'despit':145 'dinosaur':76 'dot':201 'drove':79 'drummer':88 'ear':25,84,197,257 'equip':81 'everybodi':277 'figur':28 'forehead':186 'friend':179 'front':53,217 'front-row-cent':52 'fun':118 'futur':263 'god':215 'got':50 'guitarist':93 'gun':101 'hand':21 'hear':4,49,261 'hot':212 'hot-rod':211 'jelli':178 'kept':221 'knock':110 'lawn':218 'leather':67 'leather-clad':66 'liter':113 'live':127 'look':230 'lot':64 'm':132 'machin':100 'machine-gun':99 'man':42,231 'mani':141 'memori':1 'might':37 'misplac':51 'musician':72 'neighborhood':170 'night':47 'old':41 'one':20 'paint':167 'parent':160 'pass':278 'past':267 'pave':155 'point':196 'polka':200 'polka-dot':199 'postmark':183 'proport':77 'quak':172 'question':11,250 'quit':112 'rate':71 'recal':45 'red':177 'riff':102 'road':149 'rod':213 'room':235 'row':54 'say':269 'second':70 'second-r':69 'shock':161 'show':188,204 'silenc':163,253 'skin':202 'someon':7,237 'somewher':6 'spray':96 'squad':165 'squint':15 'stand':14,226 'stare':232 'still':248 'sure':125 'surviv':130 'tantrum':91 'tell':135 'test':78,275 'textur':175 'think':208 'though':147 'threw':89 'time':86 'tint':173 'tri':26 'us':97,111,143 'voic':32 'weren':123 'whirl':94 'whisper':264 'whole':169 'wish':106 'worth':129
948	Summer near the River	324		\nI have carried my pillow to the windowsill And try to sleep, with my damp arms crossed upon it,  But no breeze stirs the tepid morning. Only I stir ... Come, tease me a little! With such cold passion, so little teasing play, How long can we endure our life together? No use. I put on your long dressing-gown; The untied sash trails over the dusty floor. I kneel by the window, prop up your shaving mirror  And pluck my eyebrows. I don’t care if the robe slides open Revealing a crescent of belly, a tan thigh. I can accuse that nonexistent breeze ... I am as monogamous as the North Star, But I don’t want you to know it. You’d only take advantage.  While you are as fickle as spring sunlight. All right, sleep! The cat means more to you than I.  I can rouse you, but then you swagger out. I glimpse you from the window, striding toward the river. When you return, reeking of fish and beer, There is salt dew in your hair. Where have you been? Your clothes weren’t that wrinkled hours ago, when you left.  You couldn’t have loved someone else, after loving me! I sulk and sigh, dawdling by the window.  Later, when you hold me in your arms It seems, for a moment, the river ceases flowing.\n	'accus':106 'advantag':131 'ago':196 'arm':20,225 'beer':177 'belli':100 'breez':26,109 'care':90 'carri':7 'cat':144 'ceas':233 'cloth':190 'cold':41 'come':34 'couldn':201 'crescent':98 'cross':21 'd':128 'damp':19 'dawdl':214 'dew':181 'dress':63 'dressing-gown':62 'dusti':71 'els':206 'endur':51 'eyebrow':86 'fickl':136 'fish':175 'floor':72 'flow':234 'glimps':161 'gown':64 'hair':184 'hold':221 'hour':195 'kneel':74 'know':125 'later':218 'left':199 'life':53 'littl':38,44 'long':48,61 'love':204,208 'mean':145 'mirror':82 'moment':230 'monogam':113 'morn':30 'near':2 'nonexist':108 'north':116 'open':95 'passion':42 'pillow':9 'play':46 'pluck':84 'prop':78 'put':58 'reek':173 'return':172 'reveal':96 'right':141 'river':4,169,232 'robe':93 'rous':153 'salt':180 'sash':67 'seem':227 'shave':81 'sigh':213 'sleep':16,142 'slide':94 'someon':205 'spring':138 'star':117 'stir':27,33 'stride':166 'sulk':211 'summer':1 'sunlight':139 'swagger':158 'take':130 'tan':102 'teas':35,45 'tepid':29 'thigh':103 'togeth':54 'toward':167 'trail':68 'tri':14 'unti':66 'upon':22 'use':56 'want':122 'weren':191 'window':77,165,217 'windowsil':12 'wrinkl':194

950	Bears at Raspberry Time	321		\nFear. Three bears are not fear, mother and cubs come berrying  in our neighborhood like any other family. I want to see them, or any  distraction. Flashlight  poking across the brook into briary darkness,  but they have gone, noisily. I go to bed.  Fear. Unwritten books already titled. Some idiot will shoot the bears soon, it always happens, they’ll be strung up by the paws in someone’s frontyard  maple to be admired and  measured, and I'll be paid  for work yet to be done— with a broken imagination.  At last I dream. Our plum tree, little, black,  twisted, gaunt in the orchard: how for a moment  last spring it flowered serenely, translucently before yielding its usual summer crop of withered  leaves. I waken, late,  go to the window, look  down to the orchard. Is middle age what makes  even dreams factual? The plum is serene and  bright in new moonlight, dressed in silver leaves, and nearby, in the waste of rough grass strewn in moonlight like diamond dust, what is it?—a dark shape  moves, and then another.  Are they ... I can’t be sure. The dark house nuzzles my knee mutely,  pleading for meaty dollars.  Fear. Wouldn’t it be great  to write nothing at all except poems about bears? \n	'across':33 'admir':78 'age':143 'alreadi':51 'alway':61 'anoth':185 'bear':1,7,58,218 'bed':47 'berri':15 'black':104 'book':50 'briari':37 'bright':154 'broken':94 'brook':35 'come':14 'crop':125 'cub':13 'dark':38,180,194 'diamond':174 'distract':30 'dollar':203 'done':91 'dream':99,147 'dress':158 'dust':175 'even':146 'except':215 'factual':148 'famili':22 'fear':5,10,48,204 'flashlight':31 'flower':117 'frontyard':74 'gaunt':106 'go':45,132 'gone':42 'grass':169 'great':209 'happen':62 'hous':195 'idiot':54 'imagin':95 'knee':198 'last':97,114 'late':131 'leav':128,161 'like':19,173 'littl':103 'll':64,83 'look':136 'make':145 'mapl':75 'measur':80 'meati':202 'middl':142 'moment':113 'moonlight':157,172 'mother':11 'move':182 'mute':199 'nearbi':163 'neighborhood':18 'new':156 'noisili':43 'noth':212 'nuzzl':196 'orchard':109,140 'paid':85 'paw':70 'plead':200 'plum':101,150 'poem':216 'poke':32 'raspberri':3 'rough':168 'see':26 'seren':118,152 'shape':181 'shoot':56 'silver':160 'someon':72 'soon':59 'spring':115 'strewn':170 'strung':66 'summer':124 'sure':192 'three':6 'time':4 'titl':52 'transluc':119 'tree':102 'twist':105 'unwritten':49 'usual':123 'waken':130 'want':24 'wast':166 'window':135 'wither':127 'work':87 'wouldn':205 'write':211 'yet':88 'yield':121

952	A Color of the Sky	322		\nWindy today and I feel less than brilliant, driving over the hills from work. There are the dark parts on the road                      when you pass through clumps of wood   and the bright spots where you have a view of the ocean,   but that doesn’t make the road an allegory. I should call Marie and apologize for being so boring at dinner last night, but can I really promise not to be that way again?   And anyway, I’d rather watch the trees, tossing   in what certainly looks like sexual arousal. Otherwise it’s spring, and everything looks frail; the sky is baby blue, and the just-unfurling leaves are full of infant chlorophyll,   the very tint of inexperience. Last summer’s song is making a comeback on the radio,   and on the highway overpass, the only metaphysical vandal in America has written   MEMORY LOVES TIME in big black spraypaint letters, which makes us wonder if Time loves Memory back. Last night I dreamed of X again. She’s like a stain on my subconscious sheets.   Years ago she penetrated me but though I scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed,   I never got her out, but now I’m glad. What I thought was an end turned out to be a middle.   What I thought was a brick wall turned out to be a tunnel.   What I thought was an injustice turned out to be a color of the sky. Outside the youth center, between the liquor store   and the police station, a little dogwood tree is losing its mind; overflowing with blossomfoam,   like a sudsy mug of beer; like a bride ripping off her clothes, dropping snow white petals to the ground in clouds, so Nature’s wastefulness seems quietly obscene.   It’s been doing that all week: making beauty, and throwing it away, and making more.\n	'ago':184 'allegori':55 'america':147 'anyway':82 'apolog':61 'arous':96 'away':310 'babi':108 'back':166 'beauti':306 'beer':274 'big':154 'black':155 'blossomfoam':268 'blue':109 'bore':65 'brick':223 'bride':277 'bright':37 'brilliant':13 'call':58 'center':249 'certain':92 'chlorophyl':120 'cloth':281 'cloud':290 'clump':32 'color':2,242 'comeback':133 'd':84 'dark':23 'dinner':67 'doesn':49 'dogwood':260 'dream':170 'drive':14 'drop':282 'end':211 'everyth':102 'feel':10 'frail':104 'full':117 'glad':205 'got':198 'ground':288 'highway':140 'hill':17 'inexperi':125 'infant':119 'injustic':236 'just-unfurl':112 'last':68,126,167 'leav':115 'less':11 'letter':157 'like':94,176,269,275 'liquor':252 'littl':259 'look':93,103 'lose':263 'love':151,164 'm':204 'make':51,131,159,305,312 'mari':59 'memori':150,165 'metaphys':144 'middl':217 'mind':265 'mug':272 'natur':292 'never':197 'night':69,168 'obscen':297 'ocean':46 'otherwis':97 'outsid':246 'overflow':266 'overpass':141 'part':24 'pass':30 'penetr':186 'petal':285 'polic':256 'promis':74 'quiet':296 'radio':136 'rather':85 'realli':73 'rip':278 'road':27,53 'scrub':191,193,195 'seem':295 'sexual':95 'sheet':182 'sky':5,106,245 'snow':283 'song':129 'spot':38 'spraypaint':156 'spring':100 'stain':178 'station':257 'store':253 'subconsci':181 'sudsi':271 'summer':127 'though':189 'thought':208,220,233 'throw':308 'time':152,163 'tint':123 'today':7 'toss':89 'tree':88,261 'tunnel':230 'turn':212,225,237 'unfurl':114 'us':160 'vandal':145 'view':43 'wall':224 'wast':294 'watch':86 'way':79 'week':304 'white':284 'windi':6 'wonder':161 'wood':34 'work':19 'written':149 'x':172 'year':183 'youth':248
953	Pro Femina	324		\n          ONE From Sappho to myself, consider the fate of women. How unwomanly to discuss it! Like a noose or an albatross necktie   The clinical sobriquet hangs us: codpiece coveters. Never mind these epithets; I myself have collected some honeys.   Juvenal set us apart in denouncing our vices Which had grown, in part, from having been set apart: Women abused their spouses, cuckolded them, even plotted   To poison them. Sensing, behind the violence of his manner— “Think I'm crazy or drunk?”—his emotional stake in us,   As we forgive Strindberg and Nietzsche, we forgive all those   Who cannot forget us. We are hyenas. Yes, we admit it. While men have politely debated free will, we have howled for it,   Howl still, pacing the centuries, tragedy heroines. Some who sat quietly in the corner with their embroidery Were Defarges, stabbing the wool with the names of their ancient   Oppressors, who ruled by the divine right of the male— I’m impatient of interruptions! I’m aware there were millions   Of mutes for every Saint Joan or sainted Jane Austen, Who, vague-eyed and acquiescent, worshiped God as a man.   I’m not concerned with those cabbageheads, not truly feminine   But neutered by labor. I mean real women, like you and like me. Freed in fact, not in custom, lifted from furrow and scullery,   Not obliged, now, to be the pot for the annual chicken,   Have we begun to arrive in time? With our well-known   Respect for life because it hurts so much to come out with it;   Disdainful of “sovereignty,” “national honor;” and other abstractions; We can say, like the ancient Chinese to successive waves of invaders,   “Relax, and let us absorb you. You can learn temperance   In a more temperate climate.” Give us just a few decades   Of grace, to encourage the fine art of acquiescence   And we might save the race. Meanwhile, observe our creative chaos,   Flux, efflorescence—whatever you care to call it!          TWO I take as my theme “The Independent Woman,” Independent but maimed: observe the exigent neckties   Choking violet writers; the sad slacks of stipple-faced matrons;   Indigo intellectuals, crop-haired and callus-toed, Cute spectacles, chewed cuticles, aced out by full-time beauties   In the race for a male. Retreating to drabness, bad manners,   And sleeping with manuscripts. Forgive our transgressions   Of old gallantries as we hitch in chairs, light our own cigarettes,   Not expecting your care, having forfeited it by trying to get even. But we need dependency, cosseting, and well-treatment.   So do men sometimes. Why don’t they admit it?   We will be cows for a while, because babies howl for us,   Be kittens or bitches, who want to eat grass now and then   For the sake of our health. But the role of pastoral heroine   Is not permanent, Jack. We want to get back to the meeting. Knitting booties and brows, tartars or termagants, ancient   Fertility symbols, chained to our cycle, released Only in part by devices of hygiene and personal daintiness,   Strapped into our girdles, held down, yet uplifted by man’s   Ingenious constructions, holding coiffures in a breeze,   Hobbled and swathed in whimsy, tripping on feminine   Shoes with fool heels, losing our lipsticks, you, me, In ephemeral stockings, clutching our handbags and packages. Our masks, always in peril of smearing or cracking, In need of continuous check in the mirror or silverware,   Keep us in thrall to ourselves, concerned with our surfaces.   Look at man’s uniform drabness, his impersonal envelope!   Over chicken wrists or meek shoulders, a formal, hard-fibered assurance.   The drape of the male is designed to achieve self-forgetfulness. So, Sister, forget yourself a few times and see where it gets you:   Up the creek, alone with your talent, sans everything else. You can wait for the menopause, and catch up on your reading.   So primp, preen, prink, pluck, and prize your flesh, All posturings! All ravishment! All sensibility! Meanwhile, have you used your mind today? What pomegranate raised you from the dead, Springing, full-grown, from your own head, Athena?          THREE          I will speak about women of letters, for I’m in the racket.   Our biggest successes to date? Old maids to a woman. And our saddest conspicuous failures? The married spinsters   On loan to the husbands they treated like surrogate fathers.   Think of that crew of self-pitiers, not-very-distant, Who carried the torch for themselves and got first-degree burns.   Or the sad sonneteers, toast-and-teasdales we loved at thirteen;   Middle-aged virgins seducing the puerile anthologists   Through lust-of-the-mind; barbiturate-drenched Camilles   With continuous periods, murmuring softly on sofas   When poetry wasn’t a craft but a sickly effluvium,   The air thick with incense, musk, and emotional blackmail. I suppose they reacted from an earlier womanly modesty   When too many girls were scabs to their stricken sisterhood,   Impugning our sex to stay in good with the men, Commencing their insecure bluster. How they must have swaggered   When women themselves endorsed their own inferiority!   Vestals, vassals, and vessels, rolled into several, They took notes in rolling syllabics, in careful journals,   Aiming to please a posterity that despises them. But we’ll always have traitors who swear that a woman surrenders   Her Supreme Function, by equating Art with aggression   And failure with Femininity. Still, it’s just as unfair To equate Art with Femininity, like a prettily packaged commodity   When we are the custodians of the world’s best-kept secret:   Merely the private lives of one-half of humanity. But even with masculine dominance, we mares and mistresses   Produced some sleek saboteuses, making their cracks Which the porridge-brained males of the day were too thick to perceive, Mistaking young hornets for perfectly harmless bumblebees. Being thought innocuous rouses some women to frenzy;   They try to be ugly by aping the ways of men And succeed. Swearing, sucking cigars and scorching the bedspread, Slopping straight shots, eyes blotted, vanity-blown In the expectation of glory: she writes like a man! This drives other women mad in a mist of chiffon. (One poetess draped her gauze over red flannels, a practical feminist.) But we’re emerging from all that, more or less, Except for some ladylike laggards and Quarterly priestesses   Who flog men for fun, and kick women to maim competition.   Now, if we struggle abnormally, we may almost seem normal; If we submerge our self-pity in disciplined industry; If we stand up and be hated, and swear not to sleep with editors; If we regard ourselves formally, respecting our true limitations   Without making an unseemly show of trying to unfreeze our assets;   Keeping our heads and our pride while remaining unmarried;   And if wedded, kill guilt in its tracks when we stack up the dishes And defect to the typewriter. And if mothers, believe in the luck of our children, Whom we forbid to devour us, whom we shall not devour, And the luck of our husbands and lovers, who keep free women.\n	'abnorm':1081 'absorb':286

954	Amusing Our Daughters	324		\nWe don’t lack people here on the Northern coast, But they are people one meets, not people one cares for.  So I bundle my daughters into the car And with my brother poets, go to visit you, brother. Here come your guests! A swarm of strangers and children; But the strangers write verses, the children are daughters like yours.  We bed down on mattresses, cots, roll up on the floor: Outside, burly old fruit trees in mist and rain; In every room, bundles asleep like larvae. We waken and count our daughters. Otherwise, nothing happens.  You feed them sweet rolls and melon, drive them all to the zoo;  Patiently, patiently, ever the father, you answer their questions.  Later, we eat again, drink, listen to poems. Nothing occurs, though we are aware you have three daughters  Who last year had four. But even death becomes part of our ease:  Poems, parenthood, sorrow, all we have learned From these of tenderness, holds us together In the center of life, entertaining daughters By firelight, with cake and songs. You, my brother, are a good and violent drinker,  Good at reciting short-line or long-line poems.  In time we will lose all our daughters, you and I, Be temperate, venerable, content to stay in one place,  Sending our messages over the mountains and waters.\n	'amus':1 'answer':119 'asleep':88 'awar':135 'becom':148 'bed':65 'brother':36,42,182 'bundl':27,87 'bur':76 'cake':177 'car':32 'care':23 'center':169 'children':52,59 'coast':13 'come':44 'content':214 'cot':69 'count':94 'daughter':3,29,61,96,139,173,207 'death':147 'drink':126 'drinker':188 'drive':107 'eas':152 'eat':124 'entertain':172 'even':146 'ever':115 'everi':85 'father':117 'feed':101 'firelight':175 'floor':74 'four':144 'fruit':78 'go':38 'good':185,189 'guest':46 'happen':99 'hold':164 'lack':7 'larva':90 'last':141 'later':122 'learn':159 'life':171 'like':62,89 'line':194,198 'listen':127 'long':197 'long-lin':196 'lose':204 'mattress':68 'meet':19 'melon':106 'messag':222 'mist':81 'mountain':225 'northern':12 'noth':98,130 'occur':131 'old':77 'one':18,22,218 'otherwis':97 'outsid':75 'parenthood':154 'part':149 'patient':113,114 'peopl':8,17,21 'place':219 'poem':129,153,199 'poet':37 'question':121 'rain':83 'recit':191 'roll':70,104 'room':86 'send':220 'short':193 'short-lin':192 'song':179 'sorrow':155 'stay':216 'stranger':50,55 'swarm':48 'sweet':103 'temper':212 'tender':163 'though':132 'three':138 'time':201 'togeth':166 'tree':79 'us':165 'vener':213 'vers':57 'violent':187 'visit':40 'waken':92 'water':227 'write':56 'year':142 'zoo':112
955	Song of the Two Crows	321		\nI sing of Morrisville  (if you call this cry       a song). I (if you call this painful voice by that great name)  sing the poverty of my       region and of the wrong end of Morrisville. You summer people will say  that all its ends are wrong,        but there, right there, the very end of the wrong end— a house with windows sagging,  leaning roadward as in defense        or maybe defiance next to the granite ledge, our cliff of broken stone that shoulders our dilapidated         one-lane iron bridge.  Who lives here? I don’t know. But they (Hermes reward them)  made this extraordinary garden,          geraniums, petunias and nasturtiums planted in every crevice and all  the footholds of the cliff.         And then they painted the cliff-face, painted the old stone; no design,  just swatches of color, bold         rough splashes  irregularly, garish orange and livid blue. Is it fluorescent, do these stones          glow in the dark? Maybe. I only know they glow in the day, so  vivid I stopped my car,         whereupon two others  came inquiring also, two crows in the broken spars of the white pine tree, cawing          above the house. Why had those who inhabited this corner of poverty painted the stones? Was it          that the flowers in living bravery nevertheless made too meager a show for the ruined cliff? Or did they          think to bring art to nature, somehow to improve this corner of ugliness? For my part I thought how          these colors were beautiful and yet strange in their beauty, ugly colors,  garish orange, livid blue;          they reminded me of those Spanish cemeteries I saw in New Mexico, tin  mirrors and plastic flowers          in the desert. Then I knew why the stones had been painted: to make  reparation, such as the poor       might make, whose sorrow  had been done here, this desecration. Is not this the burden of all poor lands          everywhere, the basis of poverty? A spoiled land makes spoiled  people. The poor know this.          I guess the crows know too, because off they flew, cawing above the bridge and the slashed hills          surrounding Morrisville.

956	The Intruder	324		\nMy mother—preferring the strange to the tame: Dove-note, bone marrow, deer dung, Frog’s belly distended with finny young, Leaf-mold wilderness, harebell, toadstool, Odd, small snakes roving through the leaves, Metallic beetles rambling over stones: all Wild and natural!—flashed out her instinctive love, and quick, she   Picked up the fluttering, bleeding bat the cat laid at her feet,   And held the little horror to the mirror, where He gazed on himself, and shrieked like an old screen door far off. Depended from her pinched thumb, each wing Came clattering down like a small black shutter. Still tranquil, she began, “It’s rather sweet ...” The soft mouse body, the hard feral glint In the caught eyes. Then we saw, And recoiled: lice, pallid, yellow, Nested within the wing-pits, cozily sucked and snoozed.   The thing dropped from her hands, and with its thud, Swiftly, the cat, with a clean careful mouth Closed on the soiled webs, growling, took them out to the back stoop. But still, dark blood, a sticky puddle on the floor   Remained, of all my mother’s tender, wounding passion   For a whole wild, lost, betrayed, and secret life   Among its dens and burrows, its clean stones,   Whose denizens can turn upon the world   With spitting tongue, an odor, talon, claw,   To sting or soil benevolence, alien As our clumsy traps, our random scatter of shot.   She swept to the kitchen. Turning on the tap,   She washed and washed the pity from her hands.\n	'alien':228 'among':201 'back':171 'bat':60 'beetl':39 'began':107 'belli':20 'benevol':227 'betray':197 'black':102 'bleed':59 'blood':176 'bodi':115 'bone':14 'burrow':205 'came':96 'care':158 'cat':62,154 'caught':122 'clatter':97 'claw':222 'clean':157,207 'close':160 'clumsi':231 'cozili':138 'dark':175 'deer':16 'den':203 'denizen':210 'depend':89 'distend':21 'door':86 'dove':12 'dove-not':11 'drop':144 'dung':17 'eye':123 'far':87 'feet':66 'feral':118 'finni':23 'flash':47 'floor':182 'flutter':58 'frog':18 'gaze':77 'glint':119 'growl':165 'hand':147,255 'hard':117 'harebel':29 'held':68 'horror':71 'instinct':50 'intrud':2 'kitchen':242 'laid':63 'leaf':26 'leaf-mold':25 'leav':37 'lice':129 'life':200 'like':82,99 'littl':70 'lost':196 'love':51 'marrow':15 'metal':38 'mirror':74 'mold':27 'mother':4,187 'mous':114 'mouth':159 'natur':46 'nest':132 'note':13 'odd':31 'odor':220 'old':84 'pallid':130 'passion':191 'pick':55 'pinch':92 'pit':137 'piti':252 'prefer':5 'puddl':179 'quick':53 'rambl':40 'random':234 'rather':110 'recoil':128 'remain':183 'rove':34 'saw':126 'scatter':235 'screen':85 'secret':199 'shot':237 'shriek':81 'shutter':103 'small':32,101 'snake':33 'snooz':141 'soft':113 'soil':163,226 'spit':217 'sticki':178 'still':104,174 'sting':224 'stone':42,208 'stoop':172 'strang':7 'suck':139 'sweet':111 'swept':239 'swift':152 'talon':221 'tame':10 'tap':246 'tender':189 'thing':143 'thud':151 'thumb':93 'toadstool':30 'tongu':218 'took':166 'tranquil':105 'trap':232 'turn':212,243 'upon':213 'wash':248,250 'web':164 'whole':194 'whose':209 'wild':44,195 'wilder':28 'wing':95,136 'wing-pit':135 'within':133 'world':215 'wound':190 'yellow':131 'young':24
957	Through a Glass Eye, Lightly	324		\nIn the laboratory waiting room containing one television actor with a teary face trying a contact lens; two muscular victims of industrial accidents;   several vain women—I was one of them—   came Deborah, four, to pick up her glass eye. It was a long day: Deborah waiting for the blood vessels painted on her iris to dry. Her mother said that, holding Deborah when she was born, “First I inspected her, from toes to navel, then stopped at her head ...” We wondered why the inspection hadn’t gone the other way.   “Looking into her eye was like looking into a volcano: “Her vacant pupil went whirling down, down to the foundation   of the world ... When she was three months old they took it out.   She giggled when she went under the anaesthetic. Forty-five minutes later she came back happy! ... The gas wore off, she found the hole in her face (you know, it never bled?), stayed happy, even when I went to pieces.   She’s five, in June. “Deborah, you get right down from there, or I’ll have to slap!” Laughing, Deborah climbed into the lap of one vain lady, who had been discontented with her own beauty.   Now she held on to Deborah, looked her steadily   in the empty eye.\n	'accid':28 'actor':14 'anaesthet':137 'back':145 'beauti':206 'bled':162 'blood':55 'born':72 'came':37,144 'climb':191 'contact':21 'contain':11 'day':50 'deborah':38,51,68,176,190,212 'discont':202 'dri':62 'empti':218 'even':165 'eye':4,45,100,219 'face':18,157 'first':73 'five':140,173 'forti':139 'forty-f':138 'found':152 'foundat':116 'four':39 'gas':148 'get':178 'giggl':131 'glass':3,44 'gone':93 'hadn':91 'happi':146,164 'head':85 'held':209 'hold':67 'hole':154 'industri':27 'inspect':75,90 'iri':60 'june':175 'know':159 'laboratori':8 'ladi':198 'lap':194 'later':142 'laugh':189 'len':22 'light':5 'like':102 'll':185 'long':49 'look':97,103,213 'minut':141 'month':124 'mother':64 'muscular':24 'navel':80 'never':161 'old':125 'one':12,34,196 'paint':57 'pick':41 'piec':170 'pupil':109 'right':179 'room':10 'said':65 'sever':29 'slap':188 'stay':163 'steadili':215 'stop':82 'teari':17 'televis':13 'three':123 'toe':78 'took':127 'tri':19 'two':23 'vacant':108 'vain':30,197 'vessel':56 'victim':25 'volcano':106 'wait':9,52 'way':96 'went':110,134,168 'whirl':111 'women':31 'wonder':87 'wore':149 'world':119
958	Lines to Accompany Flowers for Eve	324		\nThe florist was told, cyclamen or azalea;  White in either case, for you are pale As they are, “blooming early and profusely” Though the azalea grows in sandier soil,  Needing less care; while cyclamen’s fleshy tubers  Are adored, yes, rooted out by some.  One flourishes in aridness, while the other  Feeds the love which devours. But what has flung you here for salvaging  From a city’s dereliction, this New York? A world against whose finger-and-breath-marked windows  These weak flares may be set. Our only bulwark is the frailest cover:  Lovers touch from terror of being alone.  The urban surface: tough and granular,  Poor ground for the affections to take root. Left to our own devices, we devise Such curious deaths, comas, or mutilations!  You may buy peace, white, in sugary tincture,  No way of knowing its strength, or your own,  Until you lie quite still, your perfect limbs  In meditation: the spirit rouses, flutters Like a handkerchief at a cell window, signaling,  Self-amazed, its willingness to endure. The thing to cling to is the sense of expectation.  Who knows what may occur in the next breath?  In the pallor of another morning we neither  Anticipated nor wanted! Eve, waken to flowers  Unforeseen, from someone you don’t even know.  Azalea or cyclamen ... we live in wonder, Blaze in a cycle of passion and apprehension  Though once we lay and waited for a death.\n	'accompani':3 'ador':45 'affect':119 'alon':108 'amaz':177 'anoth':205 'anticip':209 'apprehens':238 'arid':54 'azalea':13,31,224 'blaze':231 'bloom':25 'breath':86,200 'bulwark':97 'buy':138 'care':38 'case':17 'cell':172 'citi':73 'cling':185 'coma':133 'cover':101 'curious':131 'cycl':234 'cyclamen':11,40,226 'death':132,247 'derelict':75 'devic':127 'devis':129 'devour':62 'earli':26 'either':16 'endur':181 'eve':6,212 'even':222 'expect':191 'feed':58 'finger':84 'finger-and-breath-mark':83 'flare':91 'fleshi':42 'florist':8 'flourish':52 'flower':4,215 'flung':66 'flutter':166 'frailest':100 'granular':114 'ground':116 'grow':32 'handkerchief':169 'know':147,193,223 'lay':242 'left':123 'less':37 'lie':155 'like':167 'limb':160 'line':1 'live':228 'love':60 'lover':102 'mark':87 'may':92,137,195 'medit':162 'morn':206 'mutil':135 'need':36 'neither':208 'new':77 'next':199 'occur':196 'one':51 'pale':21 'pallor':203 'passion':236 'peac':139 'perfect':159 'poor':115 'profus':28 'quit':156 'root':47,122 'rous':165 'salvag':70 'sandier':34 'self':176 'self-amaz':175 'sens':189 'set':94 'signal':174 'soil':35 'someon':218 'spirit':164 'still':157 'strength':149 'sugari':142 'surfac':111 'take':121 'terror':105 'thing':183 'though':29,239 'tinctur':143 'told':10 'touch':103 'tough':112 'tuber':43 'unforeseen':216 'urban':110 'wait':244 'waken':213 'want':211 'way':145 'weak':90 'white':14,140 'whose':82 'willing':179 'window':88,173 'wonder':230 'world':80 'yes':46 'york':78
959	Eternity Blues	321		\nI just had the old Dodge in the shop with that same damned front-end problem,   and I was out, so to speak, for a test run, loafing along, maybe 35 m.p.h.,   down the old Corvallis road, holding her out of the ruts and potholes. That’s out in Montana, the Bitterroot Valley.   Long ways from home is how they say it. Long ways from home, boys, long long ways from home. Might as well not put this clunker in the shop   and keep my hard-earned in my pocket,   she wobbles and humps like a scared rabbit. But it’s a real fine summer day in Corvallis,   and I’m loafing along watching the sprayers   do their slow drag on the fields of alfalfa, and I come to a side road with a little green sign   says “Kurtz Lane” and I said to myself out loud,   “Mistah Kurtz—he alive. Him doing just fine,” because of the sign, you see, and because I’m lonesome   and maybe kind of bitter in spite of the sunshine.   It’s still a goddamn long ways from home. That’s one thing, though, that Heart of Darkness,   I read that story every year, I never forget   that crazy old son-of-a-bitch, that Kurtz. And the next thing I see about a quarter-mile   down the road is somebody small on the shoulder,   a kid looking for a ride home, I figure. And he’s a kid all right, maybe ten or eleven,   but no Montana boy, he’s an Oriental,   one of those Laotians that got resettled. Can’t figure why they brought them to Montana.   He’s got those big eyes and caved-in cheeks   like the pictures on the TV during Vietnam, and his mouth is open a little. I say to myself,   I’ll give him a ride if he wants, and I even   begin to slow down, but he didn’t put up his thumb. Just when I went by, he waved,   real quick and shy, but still like he was trying   to reach me. I drove on. Then I bust out crying. \n	'35':34 'alfalfa':129 'aliv':155 'along':32,117 'begin':324 'big':286 'bitch':215 'bitter':175 'bitterroot':55 'blue':2 'boy':70,261 'brought':278 'bust':361 'cave':290 'caved-in':289 'cheek':292 'clunker':82 'come':132 'corval':39,112 'crazi':209 'cri':363 'damn':15 'dark':198 'day':110 'didn':330 'dodg':8 'drag':124 'drove':357 'earn':91 'eleven':257 'end':18 'etern':1 'even':323 'everi':203 'eye':287 'field':127 'figur':246,275 'fine':108,159 'forget':207 'front':17 'front-end':16 'give':314 'goddamn':185 'got':271,284 'green':140 'hard':90 'hard-earn':89 'heart':196 'hold':41 'home':60,69,75,189,244 'hump':98 'keep':87 'kid':239,251 'kind':173 'kurtz':143,153,217 'lane':144 'laotian':269 'like':99,293,349 'littl':139,307 'll':313 'loaf':31,116 'lonesom':170 'long':57,66,71,72,186 'look':240 'loud':151 'm':115,169 'm.p.h':35 'mayb':33,172,254 'might':76 'mile':228 'mistah':152 'montana':53,260,281 'mouth':303 'never':206 'next':220 'old':7,38,210 'one':192,266 'open':305 'orient':265 'pictur':295 'pocket':94 'pothol':48 'problem':19 'put':80,332 'quarter':227 'quarter-mil':226 'quick':344 'rabbit':102 'reach':354 'read':200 'real':107,343 'resettl':272 'ride':243,317 'right':253 'road':40,136,231 'run':30 'rut':46 'said':147 'say':64,142,309 'scare':101 'see':165,223 'shi':346 'shop':11,85 'shoulder':237 'side':135 'sign':141,163 'slow':123,326 'small':234 'somebodi':233 'son':212 'son-of-a-bitch':211 'speak':26 'spite':177 'sprayer':120 'still':183,348 'stori':202 'summer':109 'sunshin':180 'ten':255 'test':29 'thing':193,221 'though':194 'thumb':335 'tri':352 'tv':298 'valley':56 'vietnam':300 'want':320 'watch':118 'wave':342 'way':58,67,73,187 'well':78 'went':339 'wobbl':96 'year':204
960	Fanny	324		\nAt Samoa, hardly unpacked, I commenced planting, When I’d opened the chicken crates, built the Cochins a coop.   The Reverend Mr. Claxton called, found me covered with mud,   My clothes torn, my hair in a wad, my bare feet bleeding.   I had started the buffalo grass in the new-made clearing.   The next day the priest paid a visit. Civil but restless,   I was dying to plant the alfalfa seed—gave him a packet. That evening I paced up and down, dropping melon seeds,   Tomatoes and bush lima beans here and there Where I thought they would grow. We were short of food now,   So I cooked up a mess of fat little parrots, disturbed   At the way they suggested cages and swings and stands ...   An excellent meal. I have been told the dodo survived here,   And yearn for a pet on a string. And I built the pig-house. I had brought sweet coconut seed from Savage Island.   I planted kidney potatoes in small earthen hills.   Sowed seeds of eggplant in numerous boxes of soil,   Tomato and artichoke too; half-a-dozen fine pineapple   Sent over by Mr. Carruthers, the island solicitor.   As fast as we eat them, we plant the tops. The kitchen a shack near the house. I made bread in the rain. October, 1890. I have been here nearly a month; Put in corn, peas, onions, radishes, lettuce. Lima beans Are already coming up. The ripening cantaloupe were stolen.   Carruthers gave me mint root and grenadilla Like a bouquet; he delivered a load of trees, Two mangoes among them. I set them out in a heavy rain,   Then rounded off the afternoon sowing Indian corn. Louis has called me a peasant. How I brooded!   Confided it to you, diary, then crossed it out.   Peasant because I delve in the earth, the earth I own.   Confiding my seed and root—I too a creator?   My heart melts over a bed of young peas. A blossom   On the rose tree is like a poem by my son.   My hurt healed by its cause, I go on planting. No one else works much. The natives take it easy; The colonials keep their shops, and a shortage of customers.   The mail comes four times a month, and the gossip all day.   The bars are crowded with amateur politicians,   Office-seekers I named the earwig consul and king:   Big talkers, with small-time conspirators drinking them in.   Mr. Carruthers and I picked a site for the kitchen garden. I was planting a new lot of corn and pumpkin When a young chief arrived, laden with pineapple plants.   I set them out as I talked to him on the way home. Rats and a wild hen ate the corn. Lettuce got too much sun.   So I dug a new patch up the road; in the fragrant evening   I confided to Louis, a puff of the sweetest scent Blows back as I cast away a handful of so-called weeds! It still hurts, his remark that I have the soul of a peasant.   My vanity, like a newly felled tree, lies prone and bleeding.   I clear the weeds near the house for planting maize.   Sweet corn and peas are showing. I send for more seeds.   I clean out the potatoes, which had rotted in their hills. Of course, RLS is not idle; he is writing A Footnote to History: How the great powers combine to carve up these islands. I discovered the ylang-ylang tree: a base for perfume, Though it suggested to me the odor of boots. Another tree is scented like pepper and spice, And one terrible tree, I am forced to say, Smells like ordure ... It nearly made me ill. Breadfruit is plentiful. I found a banana grove, Began clearing it instantly, and worked till I was dizzy. The garden looks like a graveyard: beds shaped like tombs. I plant cabbage which I loathe, so the British won’t tease me   For not growing it. But behold! in the hedge Among citron and lime, many lemon trees, in full bearing.   Still, I will fall to brooding before the mirror, Though Louis says he finds the peasant class “interesting.” He is forty today. I am ten years his senior. On the cleared land, the green mummy-apple, Male and female, is springing up everywhere. I discover wild ginger, turmeric, something like sugar.   Roots of orange, breadfruit and mango, seeds of cacao   Came with a shipment from Sydney; also eleven Young navel orange trees. The strawberry plants are rotten.   I am given a handful of bees. I plant more pineapple.   All fall I am cursed with asthma, rheumatics, a painful ear. Christmas. A hurricane. And the New Year begins.   Louis describes it divinely to Henry James. Mr. Carruthers’ gift pineapple starts to fruit. I set out one precious rhubarb plant, pause to gloat At the ripe tomatoes, the flourishing long-podded beans.   But the neighbors’ horses break in and trample the corn.   Sometimes, when planting, a strange subterranean rumble   —Volcanic?—vexes the earth beneath this peasant haunch. I rise up from my furrow, knuckle smooth my brow As I sniff the air, suddenly chemical, a sulphurous fume.   Louis insisted on going to Sydney, fell ill again. His mother comes back with him, finds me on my knees.   The old lady’s heart leaps! Alas, I am planting, not praying. We both rise at five-thirty, after dreaming of weeds.   Louis describes to me endless vivid deeps: Dreams of nettle-stings, stabs from the citron’s thorns,   The ants’ fiery bites, the resistance of mud and slime,   The evasions of wormy roots, the dead weight of heat   In the sudden puffs of air ... Louis writes till nine,   Then if he’s well enough, he helps with the weeding. He writes Colvin, keeper of prints at the British Museum,   “I know pleasure still ... with a thousand faces, None perfect, a thousand tongues, all broken, A thousand hands, all with scratching nails ... High among joys, I place this delight of weeding, Out here alone by the garrulous water, under the silence   Of the high wind, broken by sounds of birds.” The shock of bird-calls, laughing and whistling!   They mimic his name till it seems, he says, “The birds re-live the business of my day.” But the rain continues to fall on birds and weeds. The new servants fooled around with the ice machine   As the house leaked and listed. Mildew spread its failure.   Mrs. S. gave me some nuts, and went back to Australia. Green peppers, eggplant, tomatoes are flourishing,   Asparagus also. The celery does to season soup.   Avocados grow at a rate that is almost frightening. Coconuts too. I read about Stanley and Livingstone. I cured my five ulcers with calomel, wished I could tell   Stanley the remedy. Instead, I made perfume. The servants feared devils, so I planted the orange grove alone. For two months I misplaced this diary ... War is in the air, talk of killing all whites. I bought coffee trees, rose trees, and Indian beans,   Then went to Fiji to rest, and to get more seeds   From a former Kew gardener. An Indian in a shop   Told me how to raise Persian melon and cauliflower   And a radish that turns into a turnip when it grows up. I came home to a burgeoning world: cacao, custard squash.   The new house was finished, and painted peacock blue.   The jealous old cat bit off the new cat’s toes. My mother-in-law returned with her Bible and lady’s maid;   My daughter, her family, and my son Lloyd came too.   The relatives had a terrible row. Mrs. S. refused To pray with the servants. I threw up my hands! My diary entries grow farther and farther apart. I wrote life was a strain. Later, someone crossed it out.   In pain again, from an aneurysm inside my head ... I planted more and more cacao, and a form of cherry tree,   Tobacco and rubber, taught how by Mr. Sketchley.   I planted more cacao through an epidemic of ’flu. Three hundred seeds in baskets broke through the ground. I get almost no time to write. I have been planting ...   Four kinds of cabbage are doing very well. Mr. Haggard, the land commissioner, come to dine,   Points out a weed which makes excellent eating Cooked like asparagus. I shall try it very soon. Now, when the Reverend Mr. Claxton comes to call,   I refuse to see him. I am tired of the Claxtons. The political situation grows grim. I rage at Louis Who toasts, “Her Blessed Majesty the Queen,” then aggressively   Throbbing, turns to my American son To say he may drink to the President afterward If he likes. I am writing this down Hoping Louis will see it later, and be ashamed Of his childishness and bad taste. (This will be erased.) Because war is near, the Germans stop growing cacao.   Captain Hufnagel offers me all the seeds I can use.   So now we are blazing with cacao fever, The whole family infected. Six hundred plants set out!   The verandah tracked with mud, and the cacao litter. Mrs. S. upset by the mess. Twelve hundred cacaos planted.   Joe, my son-in-law, planted his thousandth tree today. The tree onions make large bulbs but don’t want to seed.   Most vigorous: sunflower, watermelon—weeds! The jelly from berries out of the bush is delicious; Lovely perfume from massoi, citron, vanilla, and gum.   The peanuts are weeded while Joe plays on his flute.   I plant cabbage by moonlight, set out more cacao. The heart of a death’s-head moth beats a tattoo in my hand. Planted coffee all day, and breadfruit, five beauties ...   Planted coffee the better part of the day, eight plants.   In the nursery, three times that many. Planted coffee ...   Painted the storm shutters. Planted coffee all morning.   I found a heap of old bones in a bush near the sty; Two heads and a body: a warrior died with his prize.   Louis gave the bones a funeral and a burial. A series of hurricanes: Louis writes to The Times Of “the foul colonial politics.” I send to New York for seeds:   Southern Cross cabbage, eggplant, sweet potato And two thousand custard apples. Louis’ own seed,   David Balfour, is growing. I wrote nothing From June till the end of this year; too busy planting.   The Samoan princes are getting nearer to war. It pains me to write this: my son-in-law has gone native   In a spectacular way. Belle is divorcing him. Austin, my grandson, is in school in Monterey. I have not, I believe, mentioned Mrs. Stevenson recently.   She has gone back to Scotland. The first breadfruit bore.   Belle and I go on sketching expeditions To the hostile Samoan camps, stop in town for ginger beer. Mr. Haggard begged us to stay in town Because he bitterly wanted women to protect. I suggested to him that I and my daughter Could hide under his table and hand him cartridges   At the window, to complete the romantic effect.   It is clear that Mr. Haggard is Ryder’s brother! He said, “You’d sell your life for a bunch of banana trees.” I’ve given permission to most of the “boys” To go to the races. Lloyd has put up the lawn tennis things.   Mr. Gurr, the neighbor, rushes in to say war has begun.   We all race to the mission. Eleven heads have been taken.   Later: Mr. Dine’s cousin received a head smeared with black   (The custom is to return them to the bereaved). He washed it off and discovered it was his brother. He sat there, holding his brother’s head in his hands, Kissing it, bathing it with his tears. A scandal arose Because the heads of three girls have been taken as well (Unheard of before in Samoa), returned wrapped in silk to their kin. At Malie, the warriors danced a head-hunter’s pantomime;   The men who had taken heads carried great lumps of raw pork   Between their teeth, cut in the semblance of heads. I stopped writing this. Too hysterical with migraine. Also, people find where I hide it, and strike things out.   Our favorite chief is exiled for life. The war winds down.   Louis works on his masterpiece, The Weir of Hermiston. Well, I’ve kept him alive for eight more years, While his dear friends would have condemned him to fog and rain   So they might enjoy his glorious talk in London, Though it be the end of him. Fine friends! except for James.   Later: At six, Louis helped with the mayonnaise, When he put both hands to his head, said, “Oh, what a pain!   Do I look strange?” I said no, not wanting to frighten him.   He was never conscious again. In two hours he died.   Tonight, the chiefs with their axes are digging a path   To the top of the mountain. They will dig his grave. I will leave here as soon as I can, and never return,   Except to be buried beside him. I will live like a gipsy   In my wild, ragged clothes, until I am old, old.   I will have pretty gardens wherever I am, But never breadfruit, custard apples, grenadilla, cacao,   Pineapple, ylang-ylang, citron, mango, cacao,   Never again succumb to the fever of planting.\n	'1890':223 'afternoon':281 'afterward':1469 'aggress':1454 'air':871,963,1178 'ala':903 'alfalfa':72 'aliv':2086

961	The Erotic Philosophers	324		\nIt’s a spring morning; sun pours in the window  As I sit here drinking coffee, reading Augustine.  And finding him, as always, newly minted  From when I first encountered him in school.  Today I’m overcome with astonishment  At the way we girls denied all that was mean  In those revered philosophers we studied; Who found us loathsome, loathsomely seductive;  Irrelevant, at best, to noble discourse  Among the sex, the only sex that counted.  Wounded, we pretended not to mind it And wore tight sweaters to tease our shy professor. We sat in autumn sunshine “as the clouds arose  From slimy desires of the flesh, and from Youth’s seething spring.” Thank you, Augustine.  Attempting to seem blasé, our cheeks on fire, It didn’t occur to us to rush from the room. Instead we brushed aside “the briars of unclean desire”  And struggled on through mires of misogyny Till we arrived at Kierkegaard, and began to see That though Saint A. and Søren had much in common  Including fear and trembling before women, The Saint scared himself, while Søren was scared of us. Had we, poor girls, been flattered by their thralldom? Yes, it was always us, the rejected feminine  From whom temptation came. It was our flesh  With its deadly sweetness that led them on. Yet how could we not treasure Augustine, “Stuck fast in the bird-lime of pleasure”? That roomful of adolescent poets manqué Assuaged, bemused by music, let the meaning go.  Swept by those psalmic cadences, we were seduced!  Some of us tried for a while to be well-trained souls  And pious seekers, enmeshed in the Saint’s dialectic:  Responsible for our actions, yet utterly helpless. A sensible girl would have barked like a dog before God. We students, children still, were shocked to learn The children these men desired were younger than we!  Augustine fancied a girl about eleven, The age of Adeodatus, Augustine’s son. Søren, like Poe, eyed his girl before she was sixteen,  To impose his will on a malleable child, when She was not equipped to withstand or understand him.  Ah, the Pygmalion instinct! Mold the clay! Create the compliant doll that can only obey, Expecting to be abandoned, minute by minute.  It was then I abandoned philosophy, A minor loss, although I majored in it. But we were a group of sunny innocents.  I don’t believe we knew what evil meant. Now I live with a well-trained soul who deals with evil,  Including error, material or spiritual,  Easily, like changing a lock on the kitchen door. He prays at set times and in chosen places  (At meals, in church), while I Pray without thinking how or when to pray,  In a low mumble, several times a day,  Like running a continuous low fever; The sexual impulse for the most part being over.  Believing I believe. Not banking on it ever. It’s afternoon. I sit here drinking kir And reading Kierkegaard: “All sin begins with fear.” (True. We lie first from terror of our parents.)  In, I believe, an oblique crack at Augustine,  Søren said by denying the erotic It was brought to the attention of the world.  The rainbow curtain rises on the sensual:  Christians must admit it before they can deny it.  He reflected on his father’s fierce repression  Of the sexual, which had bent him out of shape;  Yet he had to pay obeisance to that power: He chose his father when he broke with his Regina. Søren said by denying the erotic It is brought to the attention of the world.  You must admit it before you can deny it.

962	Sonnet #10	321		\nYou rose from our embrace and the small light spread like an aureole around you. The long parabola of neck and shoulder, flank and thigh I saw permute itself through unfolding and unlimited minuteness in the movement of your tall tread, the spine-root swaying, the Picasso-like éclat of scissoring slender legs. I knew some law of Being was at work. At one time I had said that love bestows such values, and so it does, but the old man in his canto was right and wise: ubi amor ibi ocullus est. Always I wanted to give and in wanting was the poet. A man now, aging, I know the best of love is not to bestow, but to recognize. \n	'10':2 'age':112 'alway':98 'amor':94 'around':16 'aureol':15 'best':116 'bestow':75,122 'canto':88 'embrac':7 'est':97 'flank':25 'give':102 'ibi':95 'knew':59 'know':114 'law':61 'leg':57 'light':11 'like':13,52 'long':19 'love':74,118 'man':85,110 'minut':36 'movement':39 'neck':22 'ocullus':96 'old':84 'one':68 'parabola':20 'permut':30 'picasso':51 'picasso-lik':50 'poet':108 'recogn':125 'right':90 'root':47 'rose':4 'said':72 'saw':29 'scissor':55 'shoulder':24 'slender':56 'small':10 'sonnet':1 'spine':46 'spine-root':45 'spread':12 'sway':48 'tall':42 'thigh':27 'time':69 'tread':43 'ubi':93 'unfold':33 'unlimit':35 'valu':77 'want':100,105 'wise':92 'work':66 'éclat':53
963	None	321		\nYou died. And because you were Greek they gave you            a coin to carry under your tongue and then also  biscuits and honey. When you came to the riverbank           you saw a crazy-looking black bumboat on the water  with a figure standing in it, lanky and dressed           darkly, holding a sweep. You were taken across, and you gave your coin for the passage, and continued           until you came to a three-headed dog, who snarled  and threatened you, even though you were not trying           to escape. You gave him the biscuits smeared  with honey, and you passed onward to the field           of asphodel and through the gate of Tartarus. Or you died and you were Navajo. They had carried you           out of the hogan earlier so you’d die in the sunshine.  Or if it happened inside suddenly, they stuffed up           the smokehole and boarded the front entrance, and cut  an opening in the back, the north-facing, dark-facing           side, to carry you out, and no one ever used  that hogan again. They took off your moccasins           and put them on again wrong side to, the left one  on the right foot, the right on the left, so that your           chindi would be confused and unable to return  along your tracks. They washed your hair in suds           made from the yucca. Then they gave you  enough fried bread and water to last four days,           and you set off on your journey. But actually none of these things happened. You just died. \n	'across':58 'actual':250 'along':216 'also':21 'asphodel':107 'back':159 'biscuit':22,95 'black':37 'board':149 'bread':235 'bumboat':38 'came':27,71 'carri':15,123,169 'chindi':208 'coin':13,63 'confus':211 'continu':68 'crazi':35 'crazy-look':34 'cut':154 'd':132 'dark':51,165 'dark-fac':164 'day':241 'die':3,116,133,258 'dog':77 'dress':50 'earlier':129 'enough':233 'entranc':152 'escap':90 'even':83 'ever':175 'face':163,166 'field':105 'figur':44 'foot':199 'four':240 'fri':234 'front':151 'gate':111 'gave':10,61,92,231 'greek':8 'hair':222 'happen':140,255 'head':76 'hogan':128,178 'hold':52 'honey':24,98 'insid':141 'journey':248 'lanki':48 'last':239 'left':194,204 'look':36 'made':225 'moccasin':184 'navajo':120 'none':1,251 'north':162 'north-fac':161 'one':174,195 'onward':102 'open':156 'pass':101 'passag':66 'put':186 'return':215 'right':198,201 'riverbank':30 'saw':32 'set':244 'side':167,191 'smear':96 'smokehol':147 'snarl':79 'stand':45 'stuf':144 'sud':224 'sudden':142 'sunshin':136 'sweep':54 'taken':57 'tartarus':113 'thing':254 'though':84 'threaten':81 'three':75 'three-head':74 'tongu':18 'took':181 'track':218 'tri':88 'unabl':213 'use':176 'wash':220 'water':41,237 'would':209 'wrong':190 'yucca':228
964	The Curtain	321		\nJust over the horizon a great machine of death is roaring and rearing. \rWe can hear it always. Earthquake, starvation, the ever-renewing sump of corpse-flesh.\rBut in this valley the snow falls silently all day, and out our window \rWe see the curtain of it shifting and folding, hiding us away in our little house,\rWe see earth smoothened and beautified, made like a fantasy, the snow-clad trees\rSo graceful. In our new bed, which is big enough to seem like the north pasture almost\rWith our two cats, Cooker and Smudgins, lying undisturbed in the southeastern and southwestern corners,\rWe lie loving and warm, looking out from time to time. “Snowbound,” we say. We speak of the poet\rWho lived with his young housekeeper long ago in the mountains of the western province, the kingdom\rOf cruelty, where heads fell like wilted flowers and snow fell for many months\rAcross the pass and drifted deep in the vale. In our kitchen the maple-fire murmurs\rIn our stove. We eat cheese and new-made bread and jumbo Spanish olives\rWhich have been steeped in our special brine of jalapeños and garlic and dill and thyme.\rWe have a nip or two from the small inexpensive cognac that makes us smile and sigh.\rFor a while we close the immense index of images that is our lives—for instance,\rThe child on the Mescalero reservation in New Mexico sitting naked in 1966 outside his family’s hut,\rCovered with sores, unable to speak. But of course we see the child every day,\rWe hold out our hands, we touch him shyly, we make offerings to his implacability.\rNo, the index cannot close. And how shall we survive? We don’t and cannot and will never\rKnow. Beyond the horizon a great unceasing noise is undeniable. The machine,\rLike an immense clanking vibrating shuddering unnameable contraption as big as a house, as big as the whole town,\rMay break through and lurch into our valley at any moment, at any moment.\rCheers, baby. Here’s to us. See how the curtain of snow wavers and then falls back.\n	'1966':252 'across':159 'ago':135 'almost':93 'alway':20 'away':57 'babi':352 'back':367 'beautifi':67 'bed':82 'beyond':307 'big':85,327,332 'bread':186 'break':338 'brine':198 'cannot':291,302 'cat':97 'cheer':351 'chees':181 'child':241,270 'clad':75 'clank':321 'close':228,292 'cognac':217 'contrapt':325 'cooker':98 'corner':108 'corps':30 'corpse-flesh':29 'cours':266 'cover':258 'cruelti':146 'curtain':2,49,360 'day':41,272 'death':11 'deep':164 'dill':204 'drift':163 'earth':64 'earthquak':21 'eat':180 'enough':86 'ever':25 'ever-renew':24 'everi':271 'fall':38,366 'famili':255 'fantasi':71 'fell':149,155 'fire':174 'flesh':31 'flower':152 'fold':54 'garlic':202 'grace':78 'great':8,311 'hand':277 'head':148 'hear':18 'hide':55 'hold':274 'horizon':6,309 'hous':61,330 'housekeep':133 'hut':257 'imag':233 'immens':230,320 'implac':287 'index':231,290 'inexpens':216 'instanc':239 'jalapeño':200 'jumbo':188 'kingdom':144 'kitchen':170 'know':306 'lie':101,110 'like':69,89,150,318 'littl':60 'live':129,237 'long':134 'look':114 'love':111 'lurch':341 'machin':9,317 'made':68,185 'make':219,283 'mani':157 'mapl':173 'maple-fir':172 'may':337 'mescalero':244 'mexico':248 'moment':347,350 'month':158 'mountain':138 'murmur':175 'nake':250 'never':305 'new':81,184,247 'new-mad':183 'nip':210 'nois':313 'north':91 'offer':284 'oliv':190 'outsid':253 'pass':161 'pastur':92 'poet':127 'provinc':142 'rear':15 'renew':26 'reserv':245 'roar':13 'say':122 'see':47,63,268,357 'seem':88 'shall':295 'shift':52 'shudder':323 'shyli':281 'sigh':223 'silent':39 'sit':249 'small':215 'smile':221 'smoothen':65 'smudgin':100 'snow':37,74,154,362 'snow-clad':73 'snowbound':120 'sore':260 'southeastern':105 'southwestern':107 'spanish':189 'speak':124,263 'special':197 'starvat':22 'steep':194 'stove':178 'sump':27 'surviv':297 'thyme':206 'time':117,119 'touch':279 'town':336 'tree':76 'two':96,212 'unabl':261 'unceas':312 'undeni':315 'undisturb':102 'unnam':324 'us':56,220,356 'vale':167 'valley':35,344 'vibrat':322 'warm':113 'waver':363 'western':141 'whole':335 'wilt':151 'window':45 'young':132

What do they find there? Hell,  I wouldn’t go look at the grave of  Shakespeare if it was just  down the street. I wouldn’t  look at—” And I stopped.

To Tell the Truth	127		\nTo tell the truth, those brick Housing Authority buildings  For whose loveliness no soul had planned, Like random dominoes stood, worn out and facing each other,  Creating the enclosure that was our home.

The playground—iron swingchains, fences, iron monkey bars,  Iron seesaw handles, doubtless now rusted— Left a strong iron smell on my hands and in the autumn air  And rang with cries.

968	The History of America	127		\nA linear projection: a route. It crosses The ocean in many ships. Arriving in the new  Land, it cuts through and down forests and it  Keeps moving. Terrain: Rock, weaponry.  Dark trees, mastery. Grass, to yield. Earth,  Reproachful. Fox, bear, coon, wildcat  Prowl gloomily, it kills them, it skins them,  Its language alters, no account varmint, its Teeth set, nothing defeats its obsession, it becomes  A snake in the reedy river. Spits and prays,  Keeps moving. Behind it, a steel track. Cold,  Permanent. Not permanent. It will decay. This  Does not matter, it does not actually care, Murdering the buffalo, driving the laggard regiments,  The caring was a necessary myth, an eagle like  A speck in heaven dives. The line believes  That the entire wrinkled mountain range is the  Eagle’s nest, and everything tumbles in place.  It buries its balls at Wounded Knee, it rushes  Gold, it gambles. It buys plastics. Another  Ocean stops it. Soon, soon, up by its roots,  Severed, irrecoverably torn, that does not matter,  It decides, perpendicular from here: escape. A prior circle: a mouth. It is nowhere, Everywhere, swollen, warm. Expanding and contracting  It absorbs and projects children, jungles, Black shoes, pennies, blood. It speaks Too many dark, suffering languages. Reaching a hand  Toward its throat, you disappear entirely. No Wonder you fear this bleeding pulse, no wonder. \n	'absorb':195 'account':59 'actual':100 'alter':57 'america':4 'anoth':157 'arriv':17 'ball':145 'bear':44 'becom':69 'behind':81 'believ':125 'black':200 'bleed':225 'blood':203 'buffalo':104 'buri':143 'buy':155 'care':101,110 'children':198 'circl':182 'cold':86 'contract':193 'coon':45 'cross':11 'cut':23 'dark':35,208 'decay':92 'decid':175 'defeat':65 'disappear':218 'dive':122 'drive':105 'eagl':116,134 'earth':41 'entir':128,219 'escap':179 'everyth':138 'everywher':188 'expand':191 'fear':223 'forest':27 'fox':43 'gambl':153 'gloomili':48 'gold':151 'grass':38 'hand':213 'heaven':121 'histori':2 'irrecover':168 'jungl':199 'keep':30,79 'kill':50 'knee':148 'laggard':107 'land':21 'languag':56,210 'like':117 'line':124 'linear':6 'mani':15,207 'masteri':37 'matter':96,173 'mountain':130 'mouth':184 'move':31,80 'murder':102 'myth':114 'necessari':113 'nest':136 'new':20 'noth':64 'nowher':187 'obsess':67 'ocean':13,158 'penni':202 'perman':87,89 'perpendicular':176 'place':141 'plastic':156 'pray':78 'prior':181 'project':7,197 'prowl':47 'puls':226 'rang':131 'reach':211 'reedi':74 'regiment':108 'reproach':42 'river':75 'rock':33 'root':166 'rout':9 'rush':150 'set':63 'sever':167 'ship':16 'shoe':201 'skin':53 'snake':71 'soon':161,162 'speak':205 'speck':119 'spit':76 'steel':84 'stop':159 'suffer':209 'swollen':189 'teeth':62 'terrain':32 'throat':216 'torn':169 'toward':214 'track':85 'tree':36 'tumbl':139 'varmint':60 'warm':190 'weaponri':34 'wildcat':46 'wonder':221,228 'wound':147 'wrinkl':129 'yield':40
969	Three Men Walking, Three Brown Silhouettes	127		\nThey remember the dead who died in the resistance.   It is in sweet tones that they speak of them.   They shake their heads, still, after the dinner Walking back to the car, while an evening snow   That has started windlessly, white from pearl-gray,   Falls into streets that are already slushy. They shake their heads, as we do when there is something   Too strange to believe, Or as a beast does, stunned by a blow. “To die in the resistance,”   they say, “is to fail   To turn into slush, to escape this ugliness.   It is at once to leap, a creamy swan, Upward.”   Three voices: oboe, piano, cello. The high one wishes to be pleasing, the middle   To be practical, the deep to persevere. A movie theater lobby in front of them Throws its light on the sidewalk, like a woman   Swiftly emptying a bucket of water: The flakes are falling in its yellow light.   Then they pass a café, its light red neon,   Then a closed pharmacy.                                     —They pull sharp air Into their lungs, a pain that is a pleasure.   “Try to live as if there were no God,”   They don’t say, but they mean. A recollection of purity, a clean Handkerchief each man feels in his own pocket, Perturbs them, slows their pace down. Now they have seen A yellow stain on a pile of old snow Between two parked cars, where a man has peed:   The resistance. The falling flakes, falling On the men’s hats. And now The snow grows heavier, falls on their stooping shoulders. \n	'air':179 'alreadi':57 'back':35 'beast':77 'believ':73 'blow':82 'brown':5 'bucket':152 'café':167 'car':38,241 'cello':115 'clean':210 'close':174 'creami':108 'dead':10 'deep':129 'die':12,84 'dinner':33 'empti':150 'escap':98 'even':41 'fail':92 'fall':52,158,250,252,264 'feel':214 'flake':156,251 'front':137 'god':197 'gray':51 'grow':262 'handkerchief':211 'hat':257 'head':29,62 'heavier':263 'high':117 'leap':106 'light':142,162,169 'like':146 'live':191 'lobbi':135 'lung':182 'man':213,244 'mean':204 'men':2,255 'middl':124 'movi':133 'neon':171 'obo':113 'old':236 'one':118 'pace':223 'pain':184 'park':240 'pass':165 'pearl':50 'pearl-gray':49 'peed':246 'persever':131 'perturb':219 'pharmaci':175 'piano':114 'pile':234 'pleas':122 'pleasur':188 'pocket':218 'practic':127 'pull':177 'puriti':208 'recollect':206 'red':170 'rememb':8 'resist':15,87,248 'say':89,201 'seen':228 'shake':27,60 'sharp':178 'shoulder':268 'sidewalk':145 'silhouett':6 'slow':221 'slush':96 'slushi':58 'snow':42,237,261 'someth':69 'speak':23 'stain':231 'start':45 'still':30 'stoop':267 'strang':71 'street':54 'stun':79 'swan':109 'sweet':19 'swift':149 'theater':134 'three':1,4,111 'throw':140 'tone':20 'tri':189 'turn':94 'two':239 'ugli':100 'upward':110 'voic':112 'walk':3,34 'water':154 'white':47 'windless':46 'wish':119 'woman':148 'yellow':161,230

972	Saturday Night	127		\nAnd here it comes: around the world, In Chicago, Petersburg, Tokyo, the dancers Hit the floor running (the communal dancefloor Here, there, at intervals, sometimes paved,  Sometimes rotted linoleum awash in beer,  Sometimes a field across which the dancers streak Like violets across grass, sometimes packed dirt  In a township of corrugated metal roofs) And what was once prescribed ritual, the profuse Strains of premeditated art, is now improvisation,  The desperately new, where to the sine-curved  Yelps and spasms of police sirens outside The club, a spasmodic feedback ululates  The death and cremation of history,  Until a boy whose hair is purple spikes, And a girl wearing a skull That wants to say I’m cool but I’m in pain, Get up and dance together, sort of, age thirteen. Young allegorists, they’ll mime motions Of shootouts, of tortured ones in basements,  Of cold insinuations before sex Between enemies, the jubilance of the criminal.  The girl tosses her head and dances  The shoplifter’s meanness and self-betrayal For a pair of stockings, a scarf, a perfume,  The boy dances stealing the truck,  Shooting his father. The point is to become a flying viper,  A diving vulva, the great point Is experiment, like pollen flinging itself Into far other habitats, or seed  That travels a migrant bird’s gut  To be shit overseas. The creatures gamble on the whirl of life  And every adolescent body hot Enough to sweat it out on the dance floor Is a laboratory: maybe this lipstick, these boots,  These jeans, these earrings, maybe if I flip  My hair and vibrate my pelvis Exactly synched to the band’s wildfire noise  That imitates history’s catastrophe  Nuke for nuke, maybe I’ll survive, Maybe we’ll all survive. . . . At the intersection of poverty and plague The planet's children—brave, uncontrollable, juiced  Out of their gourds—invent the sacred dance. \n	'across':38,45 'adolesc':240 'age':133 'allegorist':136 'around':7 'art':68 'awash':32 'band':278 'basement':147 'becom':197 'beer':34 'betray':174 'bird':223 'bodi':241 'boot':259 'boy':102,185 'brave':310 'catastroph':286 'chicago':11 'children':309 'club':89 'cold':149 'come':6 'communal':21 'cool':120 'corrug':54 'creatur':231 'cremat':97 'crimin':159 'curv':80 'danc':129,166,186,250,320 'dancefloor':22 'dancer':15,41 'death':95 'desper':73 'dirt':49 'dive':202 'earring':263 'enemi':154 'enough':243 'everi':239 'exact':274 'experi':208 'far':214 'father':192 'feedback':92 'field':37 'fli':199 'fling':211 'flip':267 'floor':18,251 'gambl':232 'get':126 'girl':110,161 'gourd':316 'grass':46 'great':205 'gut':225 'habitat':216 'hair':104,269 'head':164 'histori':99,284 'hit':16 'hot':242 'imit':283 'improvis':71 'insinu':150 'intersect':301 'interv':26 'invent':317 'jean':261 'jubil':156 'juic':312 'laboratori':254 'life':237 'like':43,209 'linoleum':31 'lipstick':257 'll':138,292,296 'm':119,123 'mayb':255,264,290,294 'mean':170 'metal':55 'migrant':222 'mime':139 'motion':140 'new':74 'night':2 'nois':281 'nuke':287,289 'one':145 'outsid':87 'oversea':229 'pack':48 'pain':125 'pair':177 'pave':28 'pelvi':273 'perfum':183 'petersburg':12 'plagu':305 'planet':307 'point':194,206 'polic':85 'pollen':210 'poverti':303 'premedit':67 'prescrib':61 'profus':64 'purpl':106 'ritual':62 'roof':56 'rot':30 'run':19 'sacr':319 'saturday':1 'say':117 'scarf':181 'seed':218 'self':173 'self-betray':172 'sex':152 'shit':228 'shoot':190 'shootout':142 'shoplift':168 'sine':79 'sine-curv':78 'siren':86 'skull':113 'sometim':27,29,35,47 'sort':131 'spasm':83 'spasmod':91 'spike':107 'steal':187 'stock':179 'strain':65 'streak':42 'surviv':293,298 'sweat':245 'synch':275 'thirteen':134 'togeth':130 'tokyo':13 'tortur':144 'toss':162 'township':52 'travel':220 'truck':189 'ulul':93 'uncontrol':311 'vibrat':271 'violet':44 'viper':200 'vulva':203 'want':115 'wear':111 'whirl':235 'whose':103 'wildfir':280 'world':9 'yelp':81 'young':135
973	Late February	325		\nThe first warm day,  and by mid-afternoon  the snow is no more  than a washing strewn over the yards, the bedding rolled in knots  and leaking water,  the white shirts lying  under the evergreens.  Through the heaviest drifts  rise autumn’s fallen  bicycles, small carnivals  of paint and chrome,  the Octopus and Tilt-A-Whirl  beginning to turn in the sun. Now children,  stiffened by winter  and dressed, somehow,  like old men, mutter  and bend to the work  of building dams. But such a spring is brief;  by five o’clock the chill of sundown,  darkness, the blue TVs  flashing like storms in the picture windows,  the yards gone gray,  the wet dogs barking  at nothing. Far off  across the cornfields staked for streets and sewers,  the body of a farmer  missing since fall will show up in his garden tomorrow,  as unexpected as a tulip. \n	'across':124 'afternoon':11 'autumn':44 'bark':119 'bed':25 'begin':61 'bend':80 'bicycl':47 'blue':103 'bodi':133 'brief':92 'build':85 'carniv':49 'children':68 'chill':98 'chrome':53 'clock':96 'cornfield':126 'dam':86 'dark':101 'day':6 'dog':118 'dress':73 'drift':42 'evergreen':38 'fall':139 'fallen':46 'far':122 'farmer':136 'februari':2 'first':4 'five':94 'flash':105 'garden':145 'gone':114 'gray':115 'heaviest':41 'knot':28 'late':1 'leak':30 'lie':35 'like':75,106 'men':77 'mid':10 'mid-afternoon':9 'miss':137 'mutter':78 'noth':121 'o':95 'octopus':55 'old':76 'paint':51 'pictur':110 'rise':43 'roll':26 'sewer':131 'shirt':34 'show':141 'sinc':138 'small':48 'snow':13 'somehow':74 'spring':90 'stake':127 'stiffen':69 'storm':107 'street':129 'strewn':20 'sun':66 'sundown':100 'tilt':58 'tilt-a-whirl':57 'tomorrow':146 'tulip':151 'turn':63 'tvs':104 'unexpect':148 'warm':5 'wash':19 'water':31 'wet':117 'whirl':60 'white':33 'window':111 'winter':71 'work':83 'yard':23,113
974	So This Is Nebraska	325		\nThe gravel road rides with a slow gallop  over the fields, the telephone lines  streaming behind, its billow of dust  full of the sparks of redwing blackbirds. On either side, those dear old ladies, the loosening barns, their little windows  dulled by cataracts of hay and cobwebs  hide broken tractors under their skirts. So this is Nebraska. A Sunday  afternoon; July. Driving along with your hand out squeezing the air,  a meadowlark waiting on every post. Behind a shelterbelt of cedars, top-deep in hollyhocks, pollen and bees,  a pickup kicks its fenders off and settles back to read the clouds. You feel like that; you feel like letting  your tires go flat, like letting the mice  build a nest in your muffler, like being  no more than a truck in the weeds, clucking with chickens or sticky with honey  or holding a skinny old man in your lap  while he watches the road, waiting for someone to wave to. You feel like waving. You feel like stopping the car and dancing around on the road. You wave  instead and leave your hand out gliding  larklike over the wheat, over the houses. \n	'afternoon':64 'air':74 'along':67 'around':178 'back':102 'barn':41 'bee':93 'behind':20,81 'billow':22 'blackbird':31 'broken':53 'build':123 'car':175 'cataract':47 'cedar':85 'chicken':141 'cloud':106 'cluck':139 'cobweb':51 'danc':177 'dear':36 'deep':88 'drive':66 'dull':45 'dust':24 'either':33 'everi':79 'feel':108,112,167,171 'fender':98 'field':15 'flat':118 'full':25 'gallop':12 'glide':190 'go':117 'gravel':6 'hand':70,188 'hay':49 'hide':52 'hold':147 'hollyhock':90 'honey':145 'hous':197 'instead':184 'juli':65 'kick':96 'ladi':38 'lap':154 'larklik':191 'leav':186 'let':114,120 'like':109,113,119,129,168,172 'line':18 'littl':43 'loosen':40 'man':151 'meadowlark':76 'mice':122 'muffler':128 'nebraska':4,61 'nest':125 'old':37,150 'pickup':95 'pollen':91 'post':80 'read':104 'redw':30 'ride':8 'road':7,159,181 'settl':101 'shelterbelt':83 'side':34 'skinni':149 'skirt':57 'slow':11 'someon':162 'spark':28 'squeez':72 'sticki':143 'stop':173 'stream':19 'sunday':63 'telephon':17 'tire':116 'top':87 'top-deep':86 'tractor':54 'truck':135 'wait':77,160 'watch':157 'wave':164,169,183 'weed':138 'wheat':194 'window':44
975	In the Naked Bed, in Plato’s Cave	326		\nIn the naked bed, in Plato’s cave, Reflected headlights slowly slid the wall,   Carpenters hammered under the shaded window,   Wind troubled the window curtains all night long,   A fleet of trucks strained uphill, grinding,   Their freights covered, as usual. The ceiling lightened again, the slanting diagram   Slid slowly forth.                             Hearing the milkman’s chop,   His striving up the stair, the bottle’s chink,   I rose from bed, lit a cigarette, And walked to the window. The stony street   Displayed the stillness in which buildings stand,   The street-lamp’s vigil and the horse’s patience.   The winter sky’s pure capital Turned me back to bed with exhausted eyes. Strangeness grew in the motionless air. The loose   Film grayed. Shaking wagons, hooves’ waterfalls,   Sounded far off, increasing, louder and nearer.   A car coughed, starting. Morning, softly   Melting the air, lifted the half-covered chair   From underseas, kindled the looking-glass,   Distinguished the dresser and the white wall.   The bird called tentatively, whistled, called,   Bubbled and whistled, so! Perplexed, still wet   With sleep, affectionate, hungry and cold. So, so,   O son of man, the ignorant night, the travail   Of early morning, the mystery of beginning   Again and again,                          while History is unforgiven.\n	'affection':185 'air':125,149 'back':114 'bed':4,12,76,116 'begin':206 'bird':171 'bottl':70 'bubbl':176 'build':93 'call':172,175 'capit':111 'car':142 'carpent':23 'cave':8,16 'ceil':50 'chair':155 'chink':72 'chop':63 'cigarett':79 'cold':188 'cough':143 'cover':46,154 'curtain':33 'diagram':55 'display':88 'distinguish':163 'dresser':165 'earli':201 'exhaust':118 'eye':119 'far':135 'film':128 'fleet':38 'forth':58 'freight':45 'glass':162 'gray':129 'grew':121 'grind':43 'half':153 'half-cov':152 'hammer':24 'headlight':18 'hear':59 'histori':211 'hoov':132 'hors':103 'hungri':186 'ignor':196 'increas':137 'kindl':158 'lamp':98 'lift':150 'lighten':51 'lit':77 'long':36 'look':161 'looking-glass':160 'loos':127 'louder':138 'man':194 'melt':147 'milkman':61 'morn':145,202 'motionless':124 'mysteri':204 'nake':3,11 'nearer':140 'night':35,197 'o':191 'patienc':105 'perplex':180 'plato':6,14 'pure':110 'reflect':17 'rose':74 'shade':27 'shake':130 'sky':108 'slant':54 'sleep':184 'slid':20,56 'slowli':19,57 'soft':146 'son':192 'sound':134 'stair':68 'stand':94 'start':144 'still':90,181 'stoni':86 'strain':41 'strang':120 'street':87,97 'street-lamp':96 'strive':65 'tentat':173 'travail':199 'troubl':30 'truck':40 'turn':112 'undersea':157 'unforgiven':213 'uphil':42 'usual':48 'vigil':100 'wagon':131 'walk':81 'wall':22,169 'waterfal':133 'wet':182 'whistl':174,178 'white':168 'wind':29 'window':28,32,84 'winter':107
976	In the Basement of the Goodwill Store	325		\nIn musty light, in the thin brown air  of damp carpet, doll heads and rust,  beneath long rows of sharp footfalls  like nails in a lid, an old man stands  trying on glasses, lifting each pair from the box like a glittering fish  and holding it up to the light of a dirty bulb. Near him, a heap  of enameled pans as white as skulls  looms in the catacomb shadows,  and old toilets with dry red throats  cough up bouquets of curtain rods. You’ve seen him somewhere before.  He’s wearing the green leisure suit  you threw out with the garbage,  and the Christmas tie you hated,  and the ventilated wingtip shoes  you found in your father’s closet  and wore as a joke. And the glasses  which finally fit him, through which  he looks to see you looking back— two mirrors which flash and glance— are those through which one day you too will look down over the years,  when you have grown old and thin  and no longer particular, and the things you once thought  you were rid of forever have taken you back in their arms. \n	'air':15 'arm':197 'back':148,194 'basement':3 'beneath':23 'bouquet':87 'box':46 'brown':14 'bulb':61 'carpet':18 'catacomb':76 'christma':112 'closet':127 'cough':85 'curtain':89 'damp':17 'day':160 'dirti':60 'doll':19 'dri':82 'enamel':67 'father':125 'final':137 'fish':50 'fit':138 'flash':152 'footfal':28 'forev':190 'found':122 'garbag':109 'glanc':154 'glass':40,135 'glitter':49 'goodwil':6 'green':101 'grown':172 'hate':115 'head':20 'heap':65 'hold':52 'joke':132 'leisur':102 'lid':33 'lift':41 'light':10,57 'like':29,47 'long':24 'longer':178 'look':143,147,164 'loom':73 'man':36 'mirror':150 'musti':9 'nail':30 'near':62 'old':35,79,173 'one':159 'pair':43 'pan':68 'particular':179 'red':83 'rid':188 'rod':90 'row':25 'rust':22 'see':145 'seen':93 'shadow':77 'sharp':27 'shoe':120 'skull':72 'somewher':95 'stand':37 'store':7 'suit':103 'taken':192 'thin':13,175 'thing':182 'thought':185 'threw':105 'throat':84 'tie':113 'toilet':80 'tri':38 'two':149 've':92 'ventil':118 'wear':99 'white':70 'wingtip':119 'wore':129 'year':168
977	A Room in the Past	325		\nIt’s a kitchen. Its curtains fill with a morning light so bright   you can’t see beyond its windows   into the afternoon. A kitchen   falling through time with its things   in their places, the dishes jingling   up in the cupboard, the bucket   of drinking water rippled as if a truck had just gone past, but that truck   was thirty years. No one’s at home   in this room. Its counter is wiped,   and the dishrag hangs from its nail,   a dry leaf. In housedresses of mist,   blue aprons of rain, my grandmother   moved through this life like a ghost,   and when she had finished her years,   she put them all back in their places and wiped out the sink, turning her back   on the rest of us, forever. \n	'afternoon':28 'apron':94 'back':117,128 'beyond':23 'blue':93 'bright':18 'bucket':48 'counter':76 'cupboard':46 'curtain':11 'dish':41 'dishrag':81 'dri':87 'drink':50 'fall':31 'fill':12 'finish':110 'forev':134 'ghost':105 'gone':59 'grandmoth':98 'hang':82 'home':71 'housedress':90 'jingl':42 'kitchen':9,30 'leaf':88 'life':102 'light':16 'like':103 'mist':92 'morn':15 'move':99 'nail':85 'one':68 'past':5,60 'place':39,120 'put':114 'rain':96 'rest':131 'rippl':52 'room':2,74 'see':22 'sink':125 'thing':36 'thirti':65 'time':33 'truck':56,63 'turn':126 'us':133 'water':51 'window':25 'wipe':78,122 'year':66,112
979	The Giant Slide	325		\nBeside the highway, the Giant Slide with its rusty undulations lifts out of the weeds. It hasn’t been used  for a generation. The ticket booth tilts to that side where the nickels shifted  over the years. A chain link fence keeps out  the children and drunks. Blue morning glories  climb halfway up the stairs, bright clusters  of laughter. Call it a passing fancy, this slide that nobody slides down now.  Those screams have all gone east on a wind that will never stop blowing  down from the Rockies and over the plains,  where things catch on for a little while,  bright leaves in a fence, and then are gone. \n	'besid':4 'blow':88 'blue':51 'booth':29 'bright':59,105 'call':63 'catch':99 'chain':42 'children':48 'climb':54 'cluster':60 'drunk':50 'east':80 'fanci':67 'fenc':44,109 'generat':26 'giant':2,8 'glori':53 'gone':79,113 'halfway':55 'hasn':20 'highway':6 'keep':45 'laughter':62 'leav':106 'lift':14 'link':43 'littl':103 'morn':52 'never':86 'nickel':36 'nobodi':71 'pass':66 'plain':96 'rocki':92 'rusti':12 'scream':76 'shift':37 'side':33 'slide':3,9,69,72 'stair':58 'stop':87 'thing':98 'ticket':28 'tilt':30 'undul':13 'use':23 'weed':18 'wind':83 'year':40
980	Dogs Are Shakespearean, Children Are Strangers	326		\nDogs are Shakespearean, children are strangers. Let Freud and Wordsworth discuss the child, Angels and Platonists shall judge the dog, The running dog, who paused, distending nostrils, Then barked and wailed; the boy who pinched his sister,   The little girl who sang the song from Twelfth Night,   As if she understood the wind and rain, The dog who moaned, hearing the violins in concert.   —O I am sad when I see dogs or children! For they are strangers, they are Shakespearean. Tell us, Freud, can it be that lovely children   Have merely ugly dreams of natural functions?   And you, too, Wordsworth, are children truly   Clouded with glory, learned in dark Nature?   The dog in humble inquiry along the ground,   The child who credits dreams and fears the dark,   Know more and less than you: they know full well   Nor dream nor childhood answer questions well:   You too are strangers, children are Shakespearean. Regard the child, regard the animal,   Welcome strangers, but study daily things,   Knowing that heaven and hell surround us,   But this, this which we say before we’re sorry,   This which we live behind our unseen faces,   Is neither dream, nor childhood, neither   Myth, nor landscape, final, nor finished,   For we are incomplete and know no future,   And we are howling or dancing out our souls   In beating syllables before the curtain:   We are Shakespearean, we are strangers.\n	'along':123 'angel':20 'anim':164 'answer':149 'bark':35 'beat':226 'behind':192 'boy':39 'child':19,127,161 'childhood':148,200 'children':4,10,80,96,109,156 'cloud':111 'concert':70 'credit':129 'curtain':230 'daili':169 'danc':221 'dark':116,134 'discuss':17 'distend':32 'dog':1,7,26,29,63,78,119 'dream':100,130,146,198 'face':195 'fear':132 'final':205 'finish':207 'freud':14,90 'full':143 'function':103 'futur':215 'girl':46 'glori':113 'ground':125 'hear':66 'heaven':173 'hell':175 'howl':219 'humbl':121 'incomplet':211 'inquiri':122 'judg':24 'know':135,142,171,213 'landscap':204 'learn':114 'less':138 'let':13 'littl':45 'live':191 'love':95 'mere':98 'moan':65 'myth':202 'natur':102,117 'neither':197,201 'night':53 'nostril':33 'o':71 'paus':31 'pinch':41 'platonist':22 'question':150 'rain':61 're':186 'regard':159,162 'run':28 'sad':74 'sang':48 'say':183 'see':77 'shakespearean':3,9,87,158,233 'shall':23 'sister':43 'song':50 'sorri':187 'soul':224 'stranger':6,12,84,155,166,236 'studi':168 'surround':176 'syllabl':227 'tell':88 'thing':170 'truli':110 'twelfth':52 'ugli':99 'understood':57 'unseen':194 'us':89,177 'violin':68 'wail':37 'welcom':165 'well':144,151 'wind':59 'wordsworth':16,107
981	Fall River	327		\nWhen I wake now it’s below ocherous, saw-ridged \rpine beams. Haze streaks all three windows. I look up \rat the dog-eared, glossy magazine photo\rI’ve taken with me for years. It gets tacked\rlike a claim to some new wall in the next place—\rBill Russell & Wilt Chamberlain, one on one\rthe final game of the 1969 NBA championship,\rtwo hard men snapped elbowing & snatching at a basketball \ras if it were a moment one of them might stay inside \rforever. I was with\rmy father the night that game played\ron a fuzzy color television, in a jammed Fall River bar. \rSeagram & beer chasers for hoarse ex-jocks,\rsmoke rifting the air. A drunk called him “Tiger”\rand asked about the year he’d made all-state guard—\rpoint man, ball-hawk, pacer. Something he rarely spoke \rof, & almost always with a gruff mix of impatience \rand shyness. Each year,\rdays painting suburban tract houses & fighting \rwith contractors followed by\rnight shifts at the fire station\rfollowed by his kids swarming at breakfast\rand my mother trying to stay out of his way,\reach of the many stone-hard moments between 1941 & 1969—\rthey made up a city of granite mills\rby a slate & blue river. That town was my father’s \rlife, & still is.

Breathing at my side, that heavy animal,   That heavy bear who sleeps with me,   Howls in his sleep for a world of sugar,   A sweetness intimate as the water’s clasp,   Howls in his sleep because the tight-rope   Trembles and shows the darkness beneath.   —The strutting show-off is terrified,   Dressed in his dress-suit, bulging his pants,   Trembles to think that his quivering meat   Must finally wince to nothing at all. That inescapable animal walks with me, Has followed me since the black womb held,   Moves where I move, distorting my gesture,   A caricature, a swollen shadow, A stupid clown of the spirit’s motive,   Perplexes and affronts with his own darkness,   The secret life of belly and bone, Opaque, too near, my private, yet unknown,   Stretches to embrace the very dear With whom I would walk without him near,   Touches her grossly, although a word Would bare my heart and make me clear,   Stumbles, flounders, and strives to be fed   Dragging me with him in his mouthing care,   Amid the hundred million of his kind,   The scrimmage of appetite everywhere.\n	'affront':177 'although':213 'amid':239 'anger':43 'anim':71,143 'appetit':249 'bare':217 'bear':3,10,74 'beat':36 'belli':186 'beneath':110 'black':152 'bone':188 'box':56 'breath':65 'brother':58 'brutish':37 'build':52 'bulg':124 'candi':42 'care':238 'caricatur':163 'central':29 'citi':64 'clasp':95 'clear':223 'climb':50 'clown':169 'clumsi':22 'crazi':46 'dark':109,181 'dear':201 'dishevel':48 'distort':159 'drag':231 'dress':118,122 'dress-suit':121 'embrac':198 'everi':32 'everywher':250 'face':21 'factotum':47 'fed':230 'final':135 'flounder':225 'follow':148 'footbal':55 'gestur':161 'goe':5,12 'grossli':212 'hate':62 'hate-ridden':61 'heart':219 'heavi':2,9,70,73 'held':154 'honey':17 'howl':79,96 'hundr':241 'hungri':35 'inescap':142 'intim':90 'kick':53 'kind':245 'life':184 'love':40 'lumber':24 'make':221 'manifold':16 'meat':133 'million':242 'motiv':174 'mouth':237 'move':155,158 'must':134 'near':191,209 'noth':138 'one':38 'opaqu':189 'pant':126 'perplex':175 'place':33 'privat':193 'quiver':132 'ridden':63 'rope':104 'scrimmag':247 'secret':183 'shadow':166 'show':107,114 'show-off':113 'side':68 'sinc':150 'sleep':45,76,82,99 'smear':19 'spirit':172 'stretch':196 'strive':227 'strut':112 'stumbl':224 'stupid':168 'sugar':87 'suit':123 'sweet':89 'swollen':165 'terrifi':117 'think':129 'tight':103 'tight-rop':102 'ton':30 'touch':210 'trembl':105,127 'unknown':195 'walk':144,206 'water':93 'winc':136 'without':207 'womb':153 'word':215 'world':85 'would':205,216 'yet':194
983	A Letter in October	325		\nDawn comes later and later now,  and I, who only a month ago could sit with coffee every morning  watching the light walk down the hill  to the edge of the pond and place  a doe there, shyly drinking, then see the light step out upon  the water, sowing reflections  to either side—a garden of trees that grew as if by magic— now see no more than my face,  mirrored by darkness, pale and odd, startled by time. While I slept,  night in its thick winter jacket  bridled the doe with a twist of wet leaves and led her away, then brought its black horse with harness  that creaked like a cricket, and turned the water garden under. I woke,  and at the waiting window found  the curtains open to my open face;  beyond me, darkness. And I, who only wished to keep looking out,  must now keep looking in. \n	'ago':17 'away':105 'beyond':139 'black':109 'bridl':93 'brought':107 'coffe':21 'come':6 'could':18 'creak':114 'cricket':117 'curtain':133 'dark':77,141 'dawn':5 'doe':40,95 'drink':43 'edg':33 'either':56 'everi':22 'face':74,138 'found':131 'garden':59,122 'grew':63 'har':112 'hill':30 'hors':110 'jacket':92 'keep':148,153 'later':7,9 'leav':101 'led':103 'letter':2 'light':26,47 'like':115 'look':149,154 'magic':67 'mirror':75 'month':16 'morn':23 'must':151 'night':87 'octob':4 'odd':80 'open':134,137 'pale':78 'place':38 'pond':36 'reflect':54 'see':45,69 'shyli':42 'side':57 'sit':19 'slept':86 'sow':53 'startl':81 'step':48 'thick':90 'time':83 'tree':61 'turn':119 'twist':98 'upon':50 'wait':129 'walk':27 'watch':24 'water':52,121 'wet':100 'window':130 'winter':91 'wish':146 'woke':125
984	Narcissus	326		\nTHE MIND IS AN ANCIENT AND FAMOUS CAPITAL The mind is a city like London, Smoky and populous: it is a capital Like Rome, ruined and eternal, Marked by the monuments which no one Now remembers. For the mind, like Rome, contains   Catacombs, aqueducts, amphitheatres, palaces, Churches and equestrian statues, fallen, broken or soiled.   The mind possesses and is possessed by all the ruins   Of every haunted, hunted generation’s celebration. “Call us what you will: we are made such by love.”   We are such studs as dreams are made on, and   Our little lives are ruled by the gods, by Pan, Piping of all, seeking to grasp or grasping All of the grapes; and by the bow-and-arrow god, Cupid, piercing the heart through, suddenly and forever. Dusk we are, to dusk returning, after the burbing,   After the gold fall, the fallen ash, the bronze,   Scattered and rotten, after the white null statues which   Are winter, sleep, and nothingness: when   Will the houselights of the universe Light up and blaze?                             For it is not the sea Which murmurs in a shell, And it is not only heart, at harp o’clock,   It is the dread terror of the uncontrollable   Horses of the apocalypse, running in wild dread   Toward Arcturus—and returning as suddenly ... THE FEAR AND DREAD OF THE MIND OF THE OTHERS —The others were the despots of despair— The river’s freshness sailed from unknown sources— ... They snickered giggled, laughed aloud at last,   They mocked and marvelled at the statue which was   A caricature, as strained and stiff, and yet   A statue of self-love!—since self-love was To them, truly my true love, how, then, was I a stillness of nervousness   So nervous a caricature: did they suppose   Self-love was unrequited, or betrayed? They thought I had fallen in love with my own face,   And this belief became the night-like obstacle   To understanding all my unbroken suffering,   My studious self-regard, the pain of hope,   The torment of possibility: How then could I have expected them to see me   As I saw myself, within my gaze, or see That being thus seemed as a toad, a frog, a wen, a mole.   Knowing their certainty that I was only A monument, a monster who had fallen in love   With himself alone, how could I have Told them what was in me, within my heart, trembling and passionate   Within the labyrinth and caves of my mind, which is   Like every mind partly or wholly hidden from itself?   The words for what is in my heart and in my mind   Do not exist. But I must seek and search to find   Amid the vines and orchards of the vivid world of day   Approximate images, imaginary parallels For what is my heart and dark within my mind:   Comparisons and mere metaphors: for all Of them are substitutes, both counterfeit and vague: They are, at most, deceptive resemblances, False in their very likeness, like the sons Who are alike and kin and more unlike and false Because they seem the father’s very self: but each one is   —Although begotten by the same forbears—himself, The unique self, each one is unique, like every other one,   And everything, older or younger, nevertheless A passionate nonesuch who has before has been. Do you hear, do you see? Do you understand me now, and how   The words for what is my heart do not exist? THE RIVER WAS THE EMBLEM OF ALL BEAUTY:   ALL ... The river was the abundant belly of beauty itself   The river was the dream space where I walked, The river was itself and yet it was—flowing and freshening— A self anew, another self, or self renewed At every tick of eternity, and by each glint of light   Mounting or sparkling, descending to shade and black   —Had I but told them my heart, told how it was Taunted at noon and pacified at dusk, at starfall midnight   Strong in hope once more, ever in eagerness Jumping like joy, would they have heard? How could they? How, when what they knew was, like the grass, Simple and certain, known through the truth of touch, another form and fountain of falsehood’s fecundity— Gazing upon their faces as they gazed Could they have seen my faces as whores who are   Holy and deified as priestesses of hope                          —the sacred virgins of futurity— Promising dear divinity precisely because   They were disfigured ducks who might become And be, and ever beloved, white swans, noble and beautiful.                                     Could they have seen how my faces were Bonfires of worship and vigil, blazes of adoration and hope   —Surely they would have laughed again, renewed their scorn,   Giggled and snickered, cruel. Surely have said This is the puerile mania of the obsessed, The living logic of the lunatic: I was the statue of their merriment, Dead and a death, Pharoah and monster forsaken and lost. ... My faces were my apes: my apes became   Performers in the Sundays of their parks,   Buffoons or clowns in the farce or comedy When they took pleasure in knowing that they were not like me. ... I waited like obsession in solitude: The sun’s white terror tore and roared at me,   The moonlight, almond white, at night,   Whether awake or sleeping, arrested me   And sang, softly, haunted, unlike the sun But as the sun. Withheld from me or took away   Despair or peace, making me once more With thought of what had never been before——\n	'abund':597 'ador':780 'alik':509 'almond':883 'alon':395 'aloud':247 'although':529 'amid':454 'amphitheatr':46 'ancient':6 'anew':624 'anoth':625,706 'ape':834,836 'apocalyps':207 'approxim':465 'aqueduct':45 'arcturus':213 'arrest':891 'arrow':122 'ash':147 'awak':888 'away':909 'beauti':591,600,764 'becam':320,837 'becom':754 'begotten':530 'belief':319 'belli':598 'belov':759 'betray':305 'black':648 'blaze':174,778 'bonfir':773 'bow':120 'bow-and-arrow':119 'broken':53 'bronz':149 'buffoon':845 'burb':140 'call':73 'capit':9,23 'caricatur':260,295 'catacomb':44 'cave':416 'celebr':72 'certain':699 'certainti':379 'church':48 'citi':14 'clock':195 'clown':847 'comedi':852 'comparison':479 'contain':43 'could':347,397,686,721,765 'counterfeit':490 'cruel':795 'cupid':124 'dark':475 'day':464 'dead':820 'dear':744 'death':823 'decept':497 'deifi':733 'descend':644 'despair':234,910 'despot':232 'disfigur':750 'divin':745 'dread':199,211,221 'dream':89,606 'duck':751 'dusk':132,136,666 'eager':677 'emblem':588 'equestrian':50 'etern':28,634 'ever':675,758 'everi':67,423,544,631 'everyth':548 'exist':445,583 'expect':350 'face':316,717,726,771,831 'fall':144 'fallen':52,146,310,390 'fals':499,516 'falsehood':711 'famous':8 'farc':850 'father':521 'fear':219 'fecund':713 'find':453 'flow':619 'forbear':534 'forev':131 'form':707 'forsaken':827 'fountain':709 'fresh':238 'freshen':621 'frog':372 'futur':742 'gaze':361,714,720 'generat':70 'giggl':245,792 'glint':638 'god':101,123 'gold':143 'grape':115 'grasp':109,111 'grass':696 'harp':193 'haunt':68,896 'hear':563 'heard':684 'heart':127,191,408,438,473,580,655 'hidden':428 'holi':731 'hope':340,672,737,782 'hors':204 'houselight':167 'hunt':69 'imag':466 'imaginari':467 'joy':680 'jump':678 'kin':511 'knew':692 'know':377,858 'known':700 'labyrinth':414 'last':249 'laugh':246,787 'light':171,640 'like':15,24,41,324,422,503,504,543,679,694,863,867 'littl':95 'live':96,808 'logic':809 'london':16 'lost':829 'love':83,272,276,283,301,312,392 'lunat':812 'made':80,91 'make':913 'mania':803 'mark':29 'marvel':253 'mere':481 'merriment':819 'metaphor':482 'midnight':669 'might':753 'mind':3,11,40,57,224,419,424,442,478 'mock':251 'mole':376 'monster':387,826 'monument':32,385 'moonlight':882 'mount':641 'murmur':182 'must':448 'narcissus':1 'nervous':291,293 'never':922 'nevertheless':552 'night':323,886 'night-lik':322 'nobl':762 'nonesuch':555 'noon':662 'nothing':163 'null':156 'o':194 'obsess':806,868 'obstacl':325 'older':549 'one':35,527,540,546 'orchard':458 'other':227,229 'pacifi':664 'pain':338 'palac':47 'pan':103 'parallel':468 'park':844 'part':425 'passion':411,554 'peac':912 'perform':838 'pharoah':824 'pierc':125 'pipe':104 'pleasur':856 'popul':19 'possess':58,61 'possibl':344 'precis':746 'priestess':735 'promis':743 'pueril':802 'regard':336 'rememb':37 'renew':629,789 'resembl':498 'return':137,215 'river':236,585,594,603,612 'roar':878 'rome':25,42 'rotten':152 'ruin':26,65 'rule':98 'run':208 'sacr':739 'said':798 'sail':239 'sang':894 'saw':357 'scatter':150 'scorn':791 'sea':180 'search':451 'see':353,363,566 'seek':107,449 'seem':367,519 'seen':724,768 'self':271,275,300,335,524,538,623,626,628 'self-lov':270,274,299 'self-regard':334 'shade':646 'shell':185 'simpl':697 'sinc':273 'sleep':161,890 'smoki':17 'snicker':244,794 'soft':895 'soil':55 'solitud':870 'son':506 'sourc':242 'space':607 'sparkl':643 'starfal':668 'statu':51,157,256,268,816 'stiff':264 'still':289 'strain':262 'strong':670 'stud':87 'studious':333 'substitut':488 'sudden':129,217 'suffer':331 'sun':872,899,903 'sunday':841 'suppos':298 'sure':783,796 'swan':761 'taunt':660 'terror':200,875 'thought':307,918 'thus':366 'tick':632 'toad':370 'told':400,652,656 'took':855,908 'tore':876 'torment':342 'touch':705 'toward':212 'trembl':409 'true':282 'truli':280 'truth':703 'unbroken':330 'uncontrol':203 'understand':327,569 'uniqu':537,542 'univers':170 'unknown':241 'unlik':514,897 'unrequit':303 'upon':715 'us':74 'vagu':492 'vigil':777 'vine':456 'virgin':740 'vivid':461 'wait':866 'walk':610 'wen':374 'whether':887 'white':155,760,874,884 'wholli':427 'whore':728 'wild':210 'winter':160 'withheld':904 'within':359,406,412,476 'word':432,575 'world':462 'worship':775 'would':681,785 'yet':266,616 'younger':551
985	The Ballad of the Children of the Czar	326		\n1 The children of the Czar   Played with a bouncing ball In the May morning, in the Czar’s garden,   Tossing it back and forth. It fell among the flowerbeds   Or fled to the north gate. A daylight moon hung up In the Western sky, bald white. Like Papa’s face, said Sister,   Hurling the white ball forth.        2 While I ate a baked potato   Six thousand miles apart, In Brooklyn, in 1916,   Aged two, irrational. When Franklin D. Roosevelt   Was an Arrow Collar ad. O Nicholas! Alas! Alas! My grandfather coughed in your army, Hid in a wine-stinking barrel,   For three days in Bucharest Then left for America To become a king himself.        3 I am my father’s father, You are your children’s guilt. In history’s pity and terror   The child is Aeneas again; Troy is in the nursery, The rocking horse is on fire. Child labor! The child must carry   His fathers on his back. But seeing that so much is past   And that history has no ruth For the individual, Who drinks tea, who catches cold, Let anger be general: I hate an abstract thing.        4 Brother and sister bounced   The bounding, unbroken ball, The shattering sun fell down   Like swords upon their play, Moving eastward among the stars   Toward February and October. But the Maywind brushed their cheeks   Like a mother watching sleep, And if for a moment they fight   Over the bouncing ball And sister pinches brother   And brother kicks her shins, Well! The heart of man is known:   It is a cactus bloom.        5 The ground on which the ball bounces   Is another bouncing ball. The wheeling, whirling world   Makes no will glad. Spinning in its spotlight darkness,   It is too big for their hands. A pitiless, purposeless Thing,   Arbitrary and unspent, Made for no play, for no children,   But chasing only itself. The innocent are overtaken,   They are not innocent. They are their father’s fathers, The past is inevitable.        6 Now, in another October   Of this tragic star, I see my second year,   I eat my baked potato. It is my buttered world, But, poked by my unlearned hand, It falls from the highchair down   And I begin to howl. And I see the ball roll under   The iron gate which is locked. Sister is screaming, brother is howling,   The ball has evaded their will. Even a bouncing ball   Is uncontrollable, And is under the garden wall.   I am overtaken by terror Thinking of my father’s fathers,   And of my own will.\n	'1':9 '1916':81 '2':67 '3':125 '4':202 '5':273 '6':341 'abstract':200 'ad':93 'aenea':147 'age':82 'ala':96,97 'america':119 'among':36,223 'anger':194 'anoth':282,344 'apart':77 'arbitrari':309 'armi':103 'arrow':91 'ate':70 'back':31,170 'bake':72,358 'bald':54 'ball':19,65,210,251,279,284,386,402,410 'ballad':2 'barrel':110 'becom':121 'begin':379 'big':301 'bloom':272 'bounc':18,206,250,280,283,409 'bound':208 'brooklyn':79 'brother':203,255,257,398 'brush':233 'bucharest':115 'butter':363 'cactus':271 'carri':165 'catch':191 'chase':320 'cheek':235 'child':145,160,163 'children':5,11,135,318 'cold':192 'collar':92 'cough':100 'czar':8,14,26 'd':87 'dark':297 'day':113 'daylight':46 'drink':188 'eastward':222 'eat':356 'evad':404 'even':407 'face':59 'fall':372 'father':129,131,167,334,336,427,429 'februari':227 'fell':35,214 'fight':247 'fire':159 'fled':40 'flowerb':38 'forth':33,66 'franklin':86 'garden':28,417 'gate':44,391 'general':196 'glad':292 'grandfath':99 'ground':275 'guilt':137 'hand':304,370 'hate':198 'heart':263 'hid':104 'highchair':375 'histori':139,180 'hors':156 'howl':381,400 'hung':48 'hurl':62 'individu':186 'inevit':340 'innoc':324,330 'iron':390 'irrat':84 'kick':258 'king':123 'known':267 'labor':161 'left':117 'let':193 'like':56,216,236 'lock':394 'made':312 'make':289 'man':265 'may':22 'maywind':232 'mile':76 'moment':245 'moon':47 'morn':23 'mother':238 'move':221 'much':175 'must':164 'nichola':95 'north':43 'nurseri':153 'o':94 'octob':229,345 'overtaken':326,421 'papa':57 'past':177,338 'pinch':254 'piti':141 'pitiless':306 'play':15,220,315 'poke':366 'potato':73,359 'purposeless':307 'rock':155 'roll':387 'roosevelt':88 'ruth':183 'said':60 'scream':397 'second':353 'see':172,351,384 'shatter':212 'shin':260 'sister':61,205,253,395 'six':74 'sky':53 'sleep':240 'spin':293 'spotlight':296 'star':225,349 'stink':109 'sun':213 'sword':217 'tea':189 'terror':143,423 'thing':201,308 'think':424 'thousand':75 'three':112 'toss':29 'toward':226 'tragic':348 'troy':149 'two':83 'unbroken':209 'uncontrol':412 'unlearn':369 'unspent':311 'upon':218 'wall':418 'watch':239 'well':261 'western':52 'wheel':286 'whirl':287 'white':55,64 'wine':108 'wine-stink':107 'world':288,364 'year':354
986	The True-Blue American	326		\nJeremiah Dickson was a true-blue American, For he was a little boy who understood America, for he felt that he must Think about everything; because that’s all there is to think about,   Knowing immediately the intimacy of truth and comedy,   Knowing intuitively how a sense of humor was a necessity   For one and for all who live in America. Thus, natively, and   Naturally when on an April Sunday in an ice cream parlor Jeremiah   Was requested to choose between a chocolate sundae and a banana split He answered unhesitatingly, having no need to think of it Being a true-blue American, determined to continue as he began:   Rejecting the either-or of Kierkegaard, and many another European;   Refusing to accept alternatives, refusing to believe the choice of between; Rejecting selection; denying dilemma; electing absolute affirmation: knowing          in his breast                   The infinite and the gold                   Of the endless frontier, the deathless West. “Both: I will have them both!” declared this true-blue American   In Cambridge, Massachusetts, on an April Sunday, instructed          By the great department stores, by the Five-and-Ten, Taught by Christmas, by the circus, by the vulgarity and grandeur of          Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon, Tutored by the grandeur, vulgarity, and infinite appetite gratified and            Shining in the darkness, of the light On Saturdays at the double bills of the moon pictures, The consummation of the advertisements of the imagination of the light Which is as it was—the infinite belief in infinite hope—of Columbus,            Barnum, Edison, and Jeremiah Dickson.\n	'absolut':144 'accept':130 'advertis':242 'affirm':145 'altern':131 'america':22,67 'american':5,13,110,173 'anoth':126 'answer':96 'appetit':218 'april':75,179 'banana':93 'barnum':262 'began':116 'belief':256 'believ':134 'bill':233 'blue':4,12,109,172 'boy':19 'breast':149 'cambridg':175 'canyon':210 'chocol':89 'choic':136 'choos':86 'christma':195 'circus':198 'columbus':261 'comedi':48 'consumm':239 'continu':113 'cream':80 'dark':224 'deathless':160 'declar':168 'deni':141 'depart':185 'determin':111 'dickson':7,266 'dilemma':142 'doubl':232 'edison':263 'either':120 'either-or':119 'elect':143 'endless':157 'european':127 'everyth':31 'fall':206 'felt':25 'five':190 'five-and-ten':189 'frontier':158 'gold':154 'grand':209 'grandeur':203,214 'gratifi':219 'great':184 'hope':259 'humor':55 'ice':79 'imagin':245 'immedi':42 'infinit':151,217,255,258 'instruct':181 'intimaci':44 'intuit':50 'jeremiah':6,82,265 'kierkegaard':123 'know':41,49,146 'light':227,248 'littl':18 'live':65 'mani':125 'massachusett':176 'moon':236 'must':28 'nativ':69 'natur':71 'necess':58 'need':100 'niagara':205 'one':60 'parlor':81 'pictur':237 'refus':128,132 'reject':117,139 'request':84 'saturday':229 'select':140 'sens':53 'shine':221 'split':94 'store':186 'sunda':90 'sunday':76,180 'taught':193 'ten':192 'think':29,39,102 'thus':68 'true':3,11,108,171 'true-blu':2,10,107,170 'truth':46 'tutor':211 'understood':21 'unhesit':97 'vulgar':201,215 'west':161
987	Torque	327		\nAfter his ham & cheese in the drape factory cafeteria,  having slipped by the bald shipping foreman  to ride a rattling elevator to the attic where doves flicker into the massive eaves and where piled boxes of out-of-style cotton and lace won’t ever be decorating anyone’s sun parlor windows. Having dozed off in that hideout he fixed between five four-by-six cardboard storage cartons  while the rest of us pack Mediterranean Dreams  and Colonial Ruffles and drapes colored like moons,  and he wakes lost— shot through into a world of unlocked unlocking light— suddenly he knows where he is and feels half nuts  and feels like killing some pigeons with a slingshot. That’s all, and that’s why he pokes his calloused fingers into the broken machinery,  hunting for loose nuts a half inch wide— five greasy cold ones that warm in his pocket— and yanks back the snag-cut strip of inner tube  with a nut snug at the curve to snap it  at the soft chest of a dopey bird. Then the noise of pigeons flopping down  to creosoted hardwood, and then a grin  the guy gives me & all his other pals later.  And afternoon tightens down on all  our shoulders, until the shift whistle  blasts, blowing through the plant like air  through lace. As it always has, as it does.  That bright.

988	Baudelaire	326		\nWhen I fall asleep, and even during sleep, I hear, quite distinctly, voices speaking Whole phrases, commonplace and trivial,   Having no relation to my affairs.   Dear Mother, is any time left to us In which to be happy? My debts are immense. My bank account is subject to the court’s judgment. I know nothing. I cannot know anything.   I have lost the ability to make an effort. But now as before my love for you increases.   You are always armed to stone me, always:   It is true. It dates from childhood. For the first time in my long life I am almost happy. The book, almost finished,   Almost seems good. It will endure, a monument To my obsessions, my hatred, my disgust.   Debts and inquietude persist and weaken me.   Satan glides before me, saying sweetly: “Rest for a day! You can rest and play today.   Tonight you will work.” When night comes,   My mind, terrified by the arrears, Bored by sadness, paralyzed by impotence,   Promises: “Tomorrow: I will tomorrow.” Tomorrow the same comedy enacts itself   With the same resolution, the same weakness.   I am sick of this life of furnished rooms.   I am sick of having colds and headaches:   You know my strange life. Every day brings Its quota of wrath. You little know A poet’s life, dear Mother: I must write poems,   The most fatiguing of occupations. I am sad this morning. Do not reproach me. I write from a café near the post office, Amid the click of billiard balls, the clatter of dishes,   The pounding of my heart. I have been asked to write   “A History of Caricature.” I have been asked to write   “A History of Sculpture.” Shall I write a history Of the caricatures of the sculptures of you in my heart? Although it costs you countless agony, Although you cannot believe it necessary, And doubt that the sum is accurate, Please send me money enough for at least three weeks.\n	'abil':65 'account':46 'accur':319 'affair':26 'agoni':306 'almost':104,108,110 'although':301,307 'alway':81,86 'amid':250 'anyth':60 'arm':82 'arrear':160 'ask':268,278 'asleep':5 'ball':255 'bank':45 'baudelair':1 'believ':310 'billiard':254 'book':107 'bore':161 'bring':209 'café':245 'cannot':58,309 'caricatur':274,292 'childhood':93 'clatter':257 'click':252 'cold':199 'come':154 'comedi':175 'commonplac':18 'cost':303 'countless':305 'court':51 'date':91 'day':141,208 'dear':27,221 'debt':41,125 'disgust':124 'dish':259 'distinct':13 'doubt':314 'effort':69 'enact':176 'endur':115 'enough':324 'even':7 'everi':207 'fall':4 'fatigu':229 'finish':109 'first':96 'furnish':192 'glide':133 'good':112 'happi':39,105 'hatr':122 'headach':201 'hear':11 'heart':264,300 'histori':272,282,289 'immens':43 'impot':166 'increas':78 'inquietud':127 'judgment':53 'know':55,59,203,216 'least':327 'left':32 'life':101,190,206,220 'littl':215 'long':100 'lost':63 'love':75 'make':67 'mind':156 'money':323 'monument':117 'morn':236 'mother':28,222 'must':224 'near':246 'necessari':312 'night':153 'noth':56 'obsess':120 'occup':231 'offic':249 'paralyz':164 'persist':128 'phrase':17 'play':146 'pleas':320 'poem':226 'poet':218 'post':248 'pound':261 'promis':167 'quit':12 'quota':211 'relat':23 'reproach':239 'resolut':181 'rest':138,144 'room':193 'sad':163,234 'satan':132 'say':136 'sculptur':284,295 'seem':111 'send':321 'shall':285 'sick':187,196 'sleep':9 'speak':15 'stone':84 'strang':205 'subject':48 'sum':317 'sweet':137 'terrifi':157 'three':328 'time':31,97 'today':147 'tomorrow':168,171,172 'tonight':148 'trivial':20 'true':89 'us':34 'voic':14 'weak':184 'weaken':130 'week':329 'whole':16 'work':151 'wrath':213 'write':225,242,270,280,287
989	The Foggy, Foggy Blue	326		\nWhen I was a young man, I loved to write poems            And I called a spade a spade And the only only thing that made me sing            Was to lift the masks at the masquerade.   I took them off my own face,          I took them off others too And the only only wrong in all my song          Was the view that I knew what was true. Now I am older and tireder too          And the tasks with the masks are quite trying.   I’d gladly gladly stop if I only only knew          A better way to keep from lying,   And not get nervous and blue          When I said something quite untrue:   I looked all around and all over          To find something else to do:   I tried to be less romantic          I tried to be less starry-eyed too:   But I only got mixed up and frantic          Forgetting what was false and what was true. But tonight I am going to the masked ball,          Because it has occurred to me That the masks are more true than the faces:          —Perhaps this too is poetry? I no longer yearn to be naïve and stern          And masked balls fascinate me: Now that I know that most falsehoods are true          Perhaps I can join the charade?   This is, at any rate, my new and true view:          Let live and believe, I say. The only only thing is to believe in everything:          It’s more fun and safer that way!\n	'around':119 'ball':168,200 'believ':231,240 'better':98 'blue':4,109 'call':18 'charad':217 'd':88 'els':126 'everyth':242 'eye':142 'face':46,183 'fals':155 'falsehood':209 'fascin':201 'find':124 'foggi':2,3 'forget':152 'frantic':151 'fun':246 'get':106 'glad':89,90 'go':164 'got':147 'join':215 'keep':101 'knew':67,96 'know':206 'less':133,139 'let':228 'lie':103 'lift':34 'live':229 'longer':191 'look':117 'love':12 'made':29 'man':10 'mask':36,83,167,177,199 'masquerad':39 'mix':148 'naïv':195 'nervous':107 'new':224 'occur':172 'older':74 'other':51 'perhap':184,212 'poem':15 'poetri':188 'quit':85,114 'rate':222 'romant':134 'safer':248 'said':112 'say':233 'sing':31 'someth':113,125 'song':61 'spade':20,22 'starri':141 'starry-ey':140 'stern':197 'stop':91 'task':80 'thing':27,237 'tired':76 'tonight':161 'took':41,48 'tri':86,130,136 'true':70,159,180,211,226 'untru':115 'view':64,227 'way':99,250 'write':14 'wrong':57 'yearn':192 'young':9

It ran down into the neck of her sweatshirt and wet the white tops of her breasts. Her brown shoes splashed on into the light.

991	Late?	327		\nSometimes everything feels like a trick. Some days things seem to have been stolen from you.  Cash to pay the bills, your sense of humor, friendship.  You could almost believe those are what you look for as you walk around your neighborhood. But, no, instead, you get  splashes of zinnias against stucco, cactus wrens,  a pack of kids who ignore the sodium amber streetlights  which just stuttered on, because it means their mothers  want them home right this minute. And, on the corner variety  store’s wall, a crude, sun-washed mural of the angel Gabriel  defaced by thick black sideburns so he looks like a street punk,  a strutting cholo, so he seems the only creature on earth  who hasn’t heard the news that everything can be lost.  His strong upper arms curving naked and graceful  as the tan thighs of a slender, athletic girl. A girl he’s after, though she’s gotten bored waiting on the stoop and watching the sun set behind the foothills.  Sky reddening until it slams into a blue that blesses  anyone oblivious to all the negations, including the one, pal, where you think it’s possible  to step out of your heart and leave it empty as  an egg shell or a cardboard box. When you finally return home the tint of sky more or less matches the flash of a thrush as it swoops from limb to branch, acacia to willow. Standing at the kitchen counter, you pick through a carton of strawberries. Good juicy ones from the moldy and over-ripe. Choices that are easy. What do you trust anymore? The aproned man in the mercado said California strawberries, they’re the best this time of year. In bed, later, you remember the grocer, round belly under his apron,  but as you start, nearly asleep, to tell your wife about him,  how he talked about his deals, she starts reading aloud from a tattered bird guide, that the wood thrush  is “essentially useful and worthwhile.” What is worthwhile?                      Now, remember.\n	'acacia':241 'almost':30 'aloud':325 'amber':64 'angel':97 'anymor':274 'anyon':182 'apron':276,303 'arm':136 'around':41 'asleep':309 'athlet':148 'bed':293 'behind':169 'believ':31 'belli':300 'best':287 'bill':22 'bird':329 'black':102 'bless':181 'blue':179 'bore':159 'box':215 'branch':240 'cactus':54 'california':282 'cardboard':214 'carton':253 'cash':18 'choic':266 'cholo':113 'corner':84 'could':29 'counter':248 'creatur':119 'crude':90 'curv':137 'day':9 'deal':321 'defac':99 'earth':121 'easi':269 'egg':210 'empti':207 'essenti':336 'everyth':3,129 'feel':4 'final':218 'flash':230 'foothil':171 'friendship':27 'gabriel':98 'get':48 'girl':149,151 'good':256 'gotten':158 'grace':140 'grocer':298 'guid':330 'hasn':123 'heard':125 'heart':203 'home':77,220 'humor':26 'ignor':61 'includ':188 'instead':46 'juici':257 'kid':59 'kitchen':247 'late':1 'later':294 'leav':205 'less':227 'like':5,107 'limb':238 'look':36,106 'lost':132 'man':277 'match':228 'mean':72 'mercado':280 'minut':80 'moldi':261 'mother':74 'mural':94 'nake':138 'near':308 'negat':187 'neighborhood':43 'news':127 'oblivi':183 'one':190,258 'over-rip':263 'pack':57 'pal':191 'pay':20 'pick':250 'possibl':197 'punk':110 're':285 'read':324 'redden':173 'rememb':296,344 'return':219 'right':78 'ripe':265 'round':299 'said':281 'seem':11,116 'sens':24 'set':168 'shell':211 'sideburn':103 'sky':172,224 'slam':176 'slender':147 'sodium':63 'sometim':2 'splash':49 'stand':244 'start':307,323 'step':199 'stolen':15 'stoop':163 'store':86 'strawberri':255,283 'street':109 'streetlight':65 'strong':134 'strut':112 'stucco':53 'stutter':68 'sun':92,167 'sun-wash':91 'swoop':236 'talk':318 'tan':143 'tatter':328 'tell':311 'thick':101 'thigh':144 'thing':10 'think':194 'though':155 'thrush':233,334 'time':289 'tint':222 'trick':7 'trust':273 'upper':135 'use':337 'varieti':85 'wait':160 'walk':40 'wall':88 'want':75 'wash':93 'watch':165 'wife':313 'willow':243 'wood':333 'worthwhil':339,342 'wren':55 'year':291 'zinnia':51

The hair was my wife’s,  long and dark, a few loose strands, a curl  she might idly have turned on a finger,  she might idly have twisted, speaking to me,  and the legs of the beetle were broken. \n	'bathtub':36 'beetl':50,89 'broken':91 'brown':7 'curl':67 'dark':61 'epiphani':2 'finger':75 'floor':33 'frail':39 'gleam':31 'hair':42,54 'hand':16,26 'hull':47 'idl':70,78 'lay':51 'leg':86 'long':59 'loos':64 'might':69,77 'net':13,22 'ran':28 'rather':18 'reclus':8 'resembl':20,24 'run':10 'seen':5 'speak':81 'spider':9 'strand':65 'swirl':40 'trail':37 'turn':72 'twist':80 'white':32 'wife':57 'woven':52
994	Zeus and Apollo	327		\nWritten on clapboard or asbestos siding, the cartoony   spray-paint signatures of Apollo and Zeus, two home boys out bombing last night in thick fog. Fog near the shade of pearls. Except they didn’t see the mist   that way, glad for their thin leather gloves. Wind raw at the wide avenue, so they cut from there to here.                               Even if this is in the past tense, tense of the totally chilled-out, even if they argued here over Krylon blue or candy-apple red,   that doesn’t mean they knocked-off and streaked home then.   And if I saw fog the shade of pearls it doesn’t mean my heart in its own corrosive and healing fog   can’t tug on thin leather gloves and stand in front of a wall, pissing off the Fates and whoever else owns that wall. Whoever owns it   means less than the dry, fallen leaves of eucalyptus   blown crackling over tar and concrete and sounding, when you shut your eyes, like every tree   bursting into leaf for the first time, speeded-up like the first minute of the world.\n	'apollo':3,17 'appl':90 'argu':82 'asbesto':8 'avenu':56 'blown':162 'blue':86 'bomb':24 'boy':22 'burst':178 'candi':89 'candy-appl':88 'cartooni':11 'chill':77 'chilled-out':76 'clapboard':6 'concret':167 'corros':122 'crackl':163 'cut':59 'didn':38 'doesn':93,114 'dri':157 'els':146 'eucalyptus':161 'even':64,79 'everi':176 'except':36 'eye':174 'fallen':158 'fate':143 'first':183,190 'fog':29,30,108,125 'front':136 'glad':45 'glove':50,132 'heal':124 'heart':118 'home':21,102 'knock':98 'knocked-off':97 'krylon':85 'last':25 'leaf':180 'leather':49,131 'leav':159 'less':154 'like':175,188 'mean':95,116,153 'minut':191 'mist':42 'near':31 'night':26 'own':147,151 'paint':14 'past':70 'pearl':35,112 'piss':140 'raw':52 'red':91 'saw':107 'see':40 'shade':33,110 'shut':172 'side':9 'signatur':15 'sound':169 'speed':186 'speeded-up':185 'spray':13 'spray-paint':12 'stand':134 'streak':101 'tar':165 'tens':71,72 'thick':28 'thin':48,130 'time':184 'total':75 'tree':177 'tug':128 'two':20 'wall':139,149 'way':44 'whoever':145,150 'wide':55 'wind':51 'world':194 'written':4 'zeus':1,19
995	Walking on Tiptoe	325		\nLong ago we quit lifting our heels like the others—horse, dog, and tiger— though we thrill to their speed as they flee. Even the mouse bearing the great weight of a nugget  of dog food is enviably graceful. There is little spring to our walk, we are so burdened with responsibility,  all of the disciplinary actions that have fallen to us, the punishments,  the killings, and all with our feet bound stiff in the skins of the conquered.  But sometimes, in the early hours,  we can feel what it must have been like  to be one of them, up on our toes, stealing past doors where others are sleeping,  and suddenly able to see in the dark. \n	'abl':116 'action':60 'ago':5 'bear':30 'bound':75 'burden':53 'conquer':82 'dark':121 'disciplinari':59 'dog':15,38 'door':109 'earli':87 'enviabl':41 'even':27 'fallen':63 'feel':91 'feet':74 'flee':26 'food':39 'grace':42 'great':32 'heel':10 'hors':14 'hour':88 'kill':69 'lift':8 'like':11,97 'littl':45 'long':4 'mous':29 'must':94 'nugget':36 'one':100 'other':13,111 'past':108 'punish':67 'quit':7 'respons':55 'see':118 'skin':79 'sleep':113 'sometim':84 'speed':23 'spring':46 'steal':107 'stiff':76 'sudden':115 'though':18 'thrill':20 'tiger':17 'tipto':3 'toe':106 'us':65 'walk':1,49 'weight':33

I am no more guilty than that thrush is who sits there stripping moss   off the wet bark of a tree. A red fleck, like his, glows at the back of my head—a beauty mark,   left by the brain’s after-jets. I would not wish for the three brains   Robert required to double-clutch his guitar and chase those sounds he had to know   led down and into a troubled dusky river, always. Three brains did Johnson no earthly good,   neither his nor Vallejo’s 4 & 1/2 worked right exactly—O bunglers, O banged-up pans of disaster! Crying for days, said Cesar, & singing for months.   How can I be so strong some times, at others weak? I wish to be free, but free to do what? To leave myself behind?   To switch channels remotely?

Days of fish, days of dog, days of sex— in that order, necessarily. In the sun all the titles are trying to vanish—phrases like trout pond diluted, the 20-point sans serif, inked-red   passion bleached now, apathetic, ghostly— words that want my attention   like movers on the street lugging mirrors, a moment when I seem to   come toward myself & then   I’m gone too.

1003	Horses on the Grass	329		\nFrom the tower window the moon draws a silver maple’s shadow across a spangled lawn;                                   horses rear, manes lashing the air, front legs floating.                               Half monarch, half shadow, the tree  aspires to the sky; one branch, cracked by lightning, scrapes the earth.                             Reflected on the grass, bent twigs are curved hooves, galloping as the moon rises. Divided it stands in wholeness, mourning its victories, praising the god of trees, the king of horses. The tree holds souls in a bark prison poised like a runner at the starting line— and bolts free, wildly pawing the ground those roots lie under.\n	'across':17 'air':26 'aspir':36 'bark':85 'bent':52 'bolt':96 'branch':41 'crack':42 'curv':55 'divid':62 'draw':11 'earth':47 'float':29 'free':97 'front':27 'gallop':57 'god':72 'grass':4,51 'ground':101 'half':30,32 'hold':81 'hoov':56 'hors':1,21,78 'king':76 'lash':24 'lawn':20 'leg':28 'lie':104 'lightn':44 'like':88 'line':94 'mane':23 'mapl':14 'monarch':31 'moon':10,60 'mourn':67 'one':40 'paw':99 'pois':87 'prais':70 'prison':86 'rear':22 'reflect':48 'rise':61 'root':103 'runner':90 'scrape':45 'shadow':16,33 'silver':13 'sky':39 'soul':82 'spangl':19 'stand':64 'start':93 'tower':7 'tree':35,74,80 'twig':53 'victori':69 'whole':66 'wild':98 'window':8
1004	To the Harbormaster	328		\nI wanted to be sure to reach you; though my ship was on the way it got caught   in some moorings. I am always tying up   and then deciding to depart. In storms and   at sunset, with the metallic coils of the tide   around my fathomless arms, I am unable   to understand the forms of my vanity   or I am hard alee with my Polish rudder   in my hand and the sun sinking. To   you I offer my hull and the tattered cordage   of my will. The terrible channels where   the wind drives me against the brown lips   of the reeds are not all behind me.

1005	A Step Away from Them	328		\nIt’s my lunch hour, so I go for a walk among the hum-colored   cabs. First, down the sidewalk   where laborers feed their dirty   glistening torsos sandwiches and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets   on. They protect them from falling   bricks, I guess. Then onto the   avenue where skirts are flipping   above heels and blow up over   grates. The sun is hot, but the   cabs stir up the air. I look   at bargains in wristwatches. There   are cats playing in sawdust.                                           On to Times Square, where the sign blows smoke over my head, and higher   the waterfall pours lightly. A   Negro stands in a doorway with a   toothpick, languorously agitating.   A blonde chorus girl clicks: he   smiles and rubs his chin. Everything   suddenly honks: it is 12:40 of   a Thursday.                 Neon in daylight is a   great pleasure, as Edwin Denby would   write, as are light bulbs in daylight.   I stop for a cheeseburger at JULIET’S   CORNER	'12':134 '40':135 'agit':117 'air':76 'among':17 'avenu':54 'away':3 'bargain':80 'blond':119 'blow':62,96 'brick':48 'bulb':154 'cab':22,72 'cat':85 'cheeseburg':161 'chin':128 'chorus':120 'click':122 'coca':37 'coca-cola':36 'cola':38 'color':21 'corner':165 'daylight':141,156 'denbi':148 'dirti':31 'doorway':112 'edwin':147 'everyth':129 'fall':47 'feed':29 'first':23 'flip':58 'girl':121 'glisten':32 'go':13 'grate':65 'great':144 'guess':50 'head':100 'heel':60 'helmet':41 'higher':102 'honk':131 'hot':69 'hour':10 'hum':20 'hum-color':19 'juliet':163 'labor':28 'languor':116 'light':106,153 'look':78 'lunch':9 'negro':108 'neon':139 'onto':52 'play':86 'pleasur':145 'pour':105 'protect':44 'rub':126 'sandwich':34 'sawdust':88 'sidewalk':26 'sign':95 'skirt':56 'smile':124 'smoke':97 'squar':92 'stand':109 'step':2 'stir':73 'stop':158 'sudden':130 'sun':67 'thursday':138 'time':91 'toothpick':115 'torso':33 'walk':16 'waterfal':104 'would':149 'wristwatch':82 'write':150 'yellow':40
1006	The Stars and the Moon	329		\nScaling ladders with buckets of white enamel, I painted the stars and the moon on my windowpanes   to hold back days and nights. I yanked the telephone and stopped the wooden clock. The weeks a lightning stroke,   desire turned to love. With my blue diamond, I sliced minutes in half and made days vanish, fooling the hours.                            I became so skillful   at firmaments that miracles occurred: a bearded comet moved across the room   breeding no omens, tearing no major kingdoms   into small provinces, but there it was,   reminding us that rock may spin and flare,   lifting the senses, burning into sight. You eased pale hands away; I saw your shoulders   recede through doorways, watched your image fail   with your famished smile. I left our room with dream-filled eyes, and standing in the sun,   I gazed at bricks and glass and saw, suddenly,   flashing in stony light, the stars and the moon.\n	'across':76 'away':111 'back':25 'beard':73 'becam':64 'blue':49 'breed':79 'brick':144 'bucket':9 'burn':104 'clock':37 'comet':74 'day':26,58 'desir':43 'diamond':50 'doorway':118 'dream':133 'dream-fil':132 'eas':108 'enamel':12 'eye':135 'fail':122 'famish':125 'fill':134 'firmament':68 'flare':100 'flash':150 'fool':60 'gaze':142 'glass':146 'half':55 'hand':110 'hold':24 'hour':62 'imag':121 'kingdom':85 'ladder':7 'left':128 'lift':101 'light':153 'lightn':41 'love':46 'made':57 'major':84 'may':97 'minut':53 'miracl':70 'moon':5,19,158 'move':75 'night':28 'occur':71 'omen':81 'paint':14 'pale':109 'provinc':88 'reced':116 'remind':93 'rock':96 'room':78,130 'saw':113,148 'scale':6 'sens':103 'shoulder':115 'sight':106 'skill':66 'slice':52 'small':87 'smile':126 'spin':98 'stand':137 'star':2,16,155 'stoni':152 'stop':34 'stroke':42 'sudden':149 'sun':140 'tear':82 'telephon':32 'turn':44 'us':94 'vanish':59 'watch':119 'week':39 'white':11 'windowpan':22 'wooden':36 'yank':30
1007	The Flight	329		\nThat day I hired a private detective to follow me,  and could not read his notes. In a tangled grove,  I hid behind white pines, compressed my body,  then watched him write, left-handed and myopic,  under an Irish cap, when I asked for help  from strangers who spoke Slavic languages.  Wary, moving ahead, I found a depot, watched an immense train churn, haloed in steam,  and boarded, second class. I had no ticket,  and my expired passport represented a drooping head with unfamiliar eyes. Unshaken, rows behind, the stranger waited,  wielding camera and pen. Across the border I disembarked, but knew he would capture me,  with soundless footsteps, even on black gravel. I tried to recall my crime. I know I am guilty, but never why. Lawless, I have ignored those signs: WRONG WAY; GO BACK and NO WAY OUT,  circles that tell me YOU ARE HERE. I gather it is the whispers that explode, the looks that make dogs whimper. When I bow in prayer I think of love; I know I’ve killed my friends, pelting them with a touch—and yet I’ve heard they are alive. Besides, that’s not the real offense. I would cross any path, or trek through swamps to find my crime. But even he,  that bald, insistent man who follows me,  unsleeping, cannot tell me what I’ve done.\n	'across':99 'ahead':57 'aliv':194 'ask':46 'back':140 'bald':219 'behind':25,91 'besid':195 'black':115 'board':71 'bodi':30 'border':101 'bow':168 'camera':96 'cannot':226 'cap':43 'captur':108 'churn':66 'circl':145 'class':73 'compress':28 'could':14 'crime':122,214 'cross':204 'day':4 'depot':61 'detect':9 'disembark':103 'dog':164 'done':232 'droop':84 'even':113,216 'expir':80 'explod':159 'eye':88 'find':212 'flight':2 'follow':11,223 'footstep':112 'found':59 'friend':181 'gather':153 'go':139 'gravel':116 'grove':22 'guilti':127 'halo':67 'hand':37 'head':85 'heard':191 'help':48 'hid':24 'hire':6 'ignor':134 'immens':64 'insist':220 'irish':42 'kill':179 'knew':105 'know':124,176 'languag':54 'lawless':131 'left':36 'left-hand':35 'look':161 'love':174 'make':163 'man':221 'move':56 'myopic':39 'never':129 'note':18 'offens':201 'passport':81 'path':206 'pelt':182 'pen':98 'pine':27 'prayer':170 'privat':8 'read':16 'real':200 'recal':120 'repres':82 'row':90 'second':72 'sign':136 'slavic':53 'soundless':111 'spoke':52 'steam':69 'stranger':50,93 'swamp':210 'tangl':21 'tell':147,227 'think':172 'ticket':77 'touch':186 'train':65 'trek':208 'tri':118 'unfamiliar':87 'unshaken':89 'unsleep':225 've':178,190,231 'wait':94 'wari':55 'watch':32,62 'way':138,143 'whimper':165 'whisper':157 'white':26 'wield':95 'would':107,203 'write':34 'wrong':137 'yet':188
1008	Crossing the Square	329		\nSquinting through eye-slits in our balaclavas,  we lurch across Washington Square Park  hunched against the wind, two hooded figures  caught in the monochrome, carrying sacks of fruit, as we’ve done for years. The frosted, starch- stiff sycamores make a lean Christmas tree seem to bulk larger, tilted under the arch and still lit in three colors. Once in January, we found a feather here and stuffed the quill  in twigs to recall that jay. The musical fountain  is here, its water gone, a limestone circle now. Though rap succeeds the bluegrass strains we’ve played in it, new praise evokes old sounds.  White branches mimic visions of past storms; some say they’ve heard ghosts moan above this ground,  once a potter’s field. No two stones are the same, of course: the drums, the tawny pears we hold,  are old masks for new things. Still, in a world  where fretted houses with façades are leveled  for condominiums, not much has altered here. At least it’s faithful to imagined views. And, after all, we know the sycamore will screen the sky in a receding wind. Now, trekking home through grit that’s mounting higher, faces upturned to test the whirling snow, in new masks, we whistle to make breath-clouds form  and disappear, and form again, and O,  my love, there’s sun in the crook of your arm.\n	'across':14 'alter':168 'arch':56 'arm':237 'balaclava':11 'bluegrass':97 'branch':110 'breath':217 'breath-cloud':216 'bulk':51 'carri':29 'caught':25 'christma':47 'circl':91 'cloud':218 'color':62 'condominium':164 'cours':138 'crook':234 'cross':1 'disappear':221 'done':36 'drum':140 'evok':106 'eye':7 'eye-slit':6 'face':202 'faith':174 'façad':160 'feather':69 'field':130 'figur':24 'form':219,223 'found':67 'fountain':83 'fret':157 'frost':40 'fruit':32 'ghost':121 'gone':88 'grit':197 'ground':125 'heard':120 'higher':201 'hold':145 'home':195 'hood':23 'hous':158 'hunch':18 'imagin':176 'januari':65 'jay':80 'know':182 'larger':52 'lean':46 'least':171 'level':162 'limeston':90 'lit':59 'love':228 'lurch':13 'make':44,215 'mask':148,211 'mimic':111 'moan':122 'monochrom':28 'mount':200 'much':166 'music':82 'new':104,150,210 'o':226 'old':107,147 'park':17 'past':114 'pear':143 'play':101 'potter':128 'prais':105 'quill':74 'rap':94 'recal':78 'reced':191 'sack':30 'say':117 'screen':186 'seem':49 'sky':188 'slit':8 'snow':208 'sound':108 'squar':3,16 'squint':4 'starch':41 'stiff':42 'still':58,152 'stone':133 'storm':115 'strain':98 'stuf':72 'succeed':95 'sun':231 'sycamor':43,184 'tawni':142 'test':205 'thing':151 'though':93 'three':61 'tilt':53 'tree':48 'trekk':194 'twig':76 'two':22,132 'upturn':203 've':35,100,119 'view':177 'vision':112 'washington':15 'water':87 'whirl':207 'whistl':213 'white':109 'wind':21,192 'world':155 'year':38
1009	New Netherland, 1654	329		\nPardon us for uttering a handful of words in any language, so cut loose are we from homes, and from His name that is still   nameless, blessed be He. We raised a prayer house— that is, we broke new wood for one, but some tough burned it, snarling: “Carve only stones for the dead.” Damp ground, no fire, no psalm we all remember.   But tall ships anchor here, and at low tide, people with wheat-colored hair look out to sea,   just as we’d searched for land. “Pray if you must,” my father said, “and when prayer fails, a story,   if it is all you have, will do.” Months past, we left Recife’s forced-worship laws in the year of their Lord sixteen hundred and fifty-four, for our new   world, old-country Amsterdam. Leagues seaward,   Spanish pirates slaughtered our scant crew, and all that was left of us (friends wheezed their last while they ragged us on) rose up on deck   and tossed our bags in the sea. We watched the wake   turn silver: kiddish wine cups, hanging bowls, a candelabrum for the promised altar, carved pointers. Books’ pages curled and sank, prayer shawls ballooned and, soaking, spiraled downward.   Just as we stared, again we heard swords clank— a French ship, the Ste. Catherine (her prow had shone   gold on a gray horizon), came to our port side and rescued us. In that commotion on deck, we crouched below—not out of fear, I swear, but stunned by luminous words that echoed oddly—beautifully—like lightning   flickering through palls of thickset clouds.   A jaunty captain rasped to us in hiding: “Where are you bound?”                                   “Amsterdam. Old country.” “Where?”              “Amsterdam.”                                  “Antilles?”                                                    “No, Amsterdam.” “Yes, yes. Nieuw Amsterdam. I’ll see you get there safely.” He meant well, bless him. Ste. Catherine sailed to land at its tip no larger   than a meadow, fanned out at its sides: Manhattan Island. Our new master, Stuyvesant, lashed us with phrases, wheffs, guzzads, that stung but were not fathomed, mercifully,   when we came on a Sabbath, more than twenty   men, women, a baby born at sea. Still cursing, he let us land, and heard our praise, then disappeared among lank citizens with faded skin who stride to the bay and brood   on water that we trust and dread, and listen   to tales unstamped by laws and never sacred.\n	'1654':3 'altar':195 'among':374 'amsterdam':143,285,289,292,296 'anchor':70 'antill':290 'babi':358 'bag':175 'balloon':205 'bay':384 'beauti':264 'bless':30,307 'book':198 'born':359 'bound':284 'bowl':189 'broke':41 'brood':386 'burn':49 'came':234,348 'candelabrum':191 'captain':275 'carv':52,196 'catherin':224,310 'citizen':376 'clank':218 'cloud':272 'color':80 'commot':244 'countri':142,287 'crew':151 'crouch':248 'cup':187 'curl':200 'curs':363 'cut':16 'd':89 'damp':58 'dead':57 'deck':171,246 'disappear':373 'downward':209 'dread':393 'echo':262 'fade':378 'fail':103 'fan':322 'father':98 'fathom':344 'fear':253 'fifti':134 'fifty-four':133 'fire':61 'flicker':267 'forc':121 'forced-worship':120 'four':135 'french':220 'friend':159 'get':301 'gold':229 'gray':232 'ground':59 'guzzad':338 'hair':81 'hand':9 'hang':188 'heard':216,369 'hide':280 'home':21 'horizon':233 'hous':37 'hundr':131 'island':328 'jaunti':274 'kiddish':185 'land':92,313,367 'languag':14 'lank':375 'larger':318 'lash':333 'last':162 'law':123,400 'leagu':144 'left':117,156 'let':365 'lightn':266 'like':265 'listen':395 'll':298 'look':82 'loos':17 'lord':129 'low':74 'lumin':259 'manhattan':327 'master':331 'meadow':321 'meant':305 'men':355 'merci':345 'month':114 'must':96 'name':25 'nameless':29 'netherland':2 'never':402 'new':1,42,138,330 'nieuw':295 'odd':263 'old':141,286 'old-countri':140 'one':45 'page':199 'pall':269 'pardon':4 'past':115 'peopl':76 'phrase':336 'pirat':147 'pointer':197 'port':237 'prais':371 'pray':93 'prayer':36,102,203 'promis':194 'prow':226 'psalm':63 'rag':165 'rais':34 'rasp':276 'recif':118 'rememb':66 'rescu':240 'rose':168 'sabbath':351 'sacr':403 'safe':303 'said':99 'sail':311 'sank':202 'scant':150 'sea':85,178,361 'search':90 'seaward':145 'see':299 'shawl':204 'ship':69,221 'shone':228 'side':238,326 'silver':184 'sixteen':130 'skin':379 'slaughter':148 'snarl':51 'soak':207 'spanish':146 'spiral':208 'stare':213 'ste':223,309 'still':28,362 'stone':54 'stori':105 'stride':381 'stun':257 'stung':340 'stuyves':332 'swear':255 'sword':217 'tale':397 'tall':68 'thickset':271 'tide':75 'tip':316 'toss':173 'tough':48 'trust':391 'turn':183 'twenti':354 'unstamp':398 'us':5,158,166,241,278,334,366 'utter':7 'wake':182 'watch':180 'water':388 'well':306 'wheat':79 'wheat-color':78 'wheez':160 'wheff':337 'wine':186 'women':356 'wood':43 'word':11,260 'world':139 'worship':122 'year':126 'yes':293,294
1010	Balm in Gilead	329		\n“Is there no balm in Gilead?” So cries  dour Jeremiah in granite tones.  “There is a balm in Gilead,” replies  a Negro spiritual. The baritone who chants it, leaning forward on the platform,  looks up, not knowing his voice is a rainstorm  that rinses air to reveal earth’s surprises. Today, the summer gone, four monarch butterflies, their breed’s survivors, sucked a flower’s last blooms,  opened their wings, orange-and-black stained glass,  and printed on the sky in zigzag lines, watch bright things rise: winter moons, the white undersides  of a California condor, once thought doomed, now flapping wide like the first bird from ashes.\n	'air':48 'ash':112 'balm':1,7,20 'bariton':28 'bird':110 'black':77 'bloom':70 'breed':62 'bright':89 'butterfli':60 'california':99 'chant':30 'condor':100 'cri':11 'doom':103 'dour':12 'earth':51 'first':109 'flap':105 'flower':67 'forward':33 'four':58 'gilead':3,9,22 'glass':79 'gone':57 'granit':15 'jeremiah':13 'know':40 'last':69 'lean':32 'like':107 'line':87 'look':37 'monarch':59 'moon':93 'negro':25 'open':71 'orang':75 'orange-and-black':74 'platform':36 'print':81 'rainstorm':45 'repli':23 'reveal':50 'rins':47 'rise':91 'sky':84 'spiritu':26 'stain':78 'suck':65 'summer':56 'surpris':53 'survivor':64 'thing':90 'thought':102 'today':54 'tone':16 'undersid':96 'voic':42 'watch':88 'white':95 'wide':106 'wing':73 'winter':92 'zigzag':86
1011	American Solitude	329		\nHopper never painted this, but here   \r on a snaky path his vision lingers:\r three white tombs, robots with glassed-in faces   \r and meters for eyes, grim mouths, flat noses,\r lean forward on a platform, like strangers   \r with identical frowns scanning a blur,\r far off, that might be their train.\r Gas tanks broken for decades face Parson’s\r smithy, planked shut now. Both relics must stay.   \r The pumps have roots in gas pools, and the smithy\r stores memories of hammers forging scythes   \r to cut spartina grass for dry salt hay.\r The tanks have the remove of local clammers   \r who sink buckets and stand, never in pairs,\r but one and one and one, blank-eyed, alone,   \r more serene than lonely. Today a woman\r rakes in the shallows, then bends to receive   \r last rays in shimmering water, her long shadow\r knifing the bay. She slides into her truck\r to watch the sky flame over sand flats, a hawk’s\r wind arabesque, an island risen, brown   \r Atlantis, at low tide; she probes the shoreline\r and beyond grassy dunes for where the land   \r might slope off into night.

1013	Poem [“The eager note on my door said, ‘Call me,’”]	328		\nThe eager note on my door said “Call me,  call when you get in!” so I quickly threw  a few tangerines into my overnight bag,  straightened my eyelids and shoulders, and headed straight for the door. It was autumn  by the time I got around the corner, oh all unwilling to be either pertinent or bemused, but  the leaves were brighter than grass on the sidewalk! Funny, I thought, that the lights are on this late  and the hall door open; still up at this hour, a  champion jai-alai player like himself? Oh fie!  for shame! What a host, so zealous! And he was there in the hall, flat on a sheet of blood that ran down the stairs. I did appreciate it. There are few  hosts who so thoroughly prepare to greet a guest  only casually invited, and that several months ago.\n	'ago':155 'alai':101 'appreci':134 'around':55 'autumn':49 'bag':35 'bemus':66 'blood':126 'brighter':71 'call':9,18,20 'casual':149 'champion':98 'corner':57 'door':7,16,46,90 'eager':3,12 'either':63 'eyelid':38 'fie':106 'flat':121 'funni':77 'get':23 'got':54 'grass':73 'greet':145 'guest':147 'hall':89,120 'head':42 'host':111,139 'hour':96 'invit':150 'jai':100 'jai-alai':99 'late':86 'leav':69 'light':82 'like':103 'month':154 'note':4,13 'oh':58,105 'open':91 'overnight':34 'pertin':64 'player':102 'poem':1 'prepar':143 'quick':27 'ran':128 'said':8,17 'sever':153 'shame':108 'sheet':124 'shoulder':40 'sidewalk':76 'stair':131 'still':92 'straight':43 'straighten':36 'tangerin':31 'thorough':142 'thought':79 'threw':28 'time':52 'unwil':60 'zealous':113
1014	Job’s Question on Nevis	329		\n“Turn back!” was all she snapped out as she passed  in a red dress that caught sunrays through mist.  I saw her lurch upwind, kick off spiked heels,  climb out to the edge of a knife-sharp rockpile, and, arms outstretched, lead the sea’s tympani,  lure the din, guiding the steamy waves  to shore. Will the Almighty answer me? she sang out to the ocean’s rising octaves, as blown palms pointed scarflike fronds to land.  Earlier that Sunday, she had prayed to a black Christ in a church on the island, droned verses for a safe calm, and trekked homeward to board white louvered windows for the storm.  She had refused the chapel’s sanctuary to ask the ocean why the wind ripped homes  and would again. Her anger captured me, and stayed when I saw rain gleam on red ginger,  drench trumpets islanders call yellow-bells,  and soak ixora. Bonelike bits of shells and conchs lay on the beach as on an altar. Silent, I watched her. Under a blank sky,  where waves broke over coral, in thick haze,  pitched forward to hear the whirlwind’s reply,  she shook a fist, then opened hands in praise.\n	'almighti':64 'altar':173 'anger':137 'answer':65 'arm':46 'ask':125 'back':7 'beach':169 'bell':156 'bit':161 'black':92 'blank':180 'blown':77 'board':110 'bonelik':160 'broke':184 'call':153 'calm':105 'captur':138 'caught':21 'chapel':121 'christ':93 'church':96 'climb':34 'conch':165 'coral':186 'din':55 'drench':150 'dress':19 'drone':100 'earlier':84 'edg':38 'fist':201 'forward':191 'frond':81 'ginger':149 'gleam':146 'guid':56 'hand':204 'haze':189 'hear':193 'heel':33 'home':132 'homeward':108 'island':99,152 'ixora':159 'job':1 'kick':30 'knife':42 'knife-sharp':41 'land':83 'lay':166 'lead':48 'louver':112 'lurch':28 'lure':53 'mist':24 'nevi':5 'ocean':72,127 'octav':75 'open':203 'outstretch':47 'palm':78 'pass':15 'pitch':190 'point':79 'prais':206 'pray':89 'question':3 'rain':145 'red':18,148 'refus':119 'repli':197 'rip':131 'rise':74 'rockpil':44 'safe':104 'sanctuari':123 'sang':68 'saw':26,144 'scarflik':80 'sea':50 'sharp':43 'shell':163 'shook':199 'shore':61 'silent':174 'sky':181 'snap':11 'soak':158 'spike':32 'stay':141 'steami':58 'storm':116 'sunday':86 'sunray':22 'thick':188 'trekk':107 'trumpet':151 'turn':6 'tympani':52 'upwind':29 'vers':101 'watch':176 'wave':59,183 'whirlwind':195 'white':111 'wind':130 'window':113 'would':134 'yellow':155 'yellow-bel':154

1017	Burning	330		\nHe lives, who last night flopped from a log  Into the creek, and all night by an ankle  Lay pinned to the flood, dead as a nail  But for the skin of the teeth of his dog. I brought him boiled eggs and broth.  He coughed and waved his spoon And sat up saying he would dine alone,  Being fatigue itself after that bath. I sat without in the sun with the dog.  Wearing a stocking on the ailing foot,  In monster crutches, he hobbled out,  And addressed the dog in bitter rage. He told the yellow hound, his rescuer,  Its heart was bad, and it ought Not wander by the creek at night; If all his dogs got drowned he would be poor. He stroked its head and disappeared in the shed  And came out with a stone mallet in his hands  And lifted that rocky weight of many pounds  And let it lapse on top of the dog's head. I carted off the carcass, dug it deep. Then he came too with what a thing to lug,  Or pour on a dog’s grave, his thundermug,  And poured it out and went indoors to sleep. I saw him sleepless in the pane of glass  Looking wild-eyed at sunset, then the glare  Blinded the glass—only a red square  Burning a house burning in the wilderness.\n	'address':89 'ail':80 'alon':59 'ankl':19 'bad':105 'bath':65 'bitter':93 'blind':218 'boil':42 'broth':45 'brought':40 'burn':1,225,228 'came':136,174 'carcass':168 'cart':165 'cough':47 'creek':13,113 'crutch':84 'dead':25 'deep':171 'dine':58 'disappear':131 'dog':38,74,91,119,161,186 'drown':121 'dug':169 'egg':43 'eye':212 'fatigu':61 'flood':24 'flop':7 'foot':81 'glare':217 'glass':208,220 'got':120 'grave':188 'hand':144 'head':129,163 'heart':103 'hobbl':86 'hound':99 'hous':227 'indoor':197 'laps':156 'last':5 'lay':20 'let':154 'lift':146 'live':3 'log':10 'look':209 'lug':181 'mallet':141 'mani':151 'monster':83 'nail':28 'night':6,16,115 'ought':108 'pane':206 'pin':21 'poor':125 'pound':152 'pour':183,192 'rage':94 'red':223 'rescuer':101 'rocki':148 'sat':53,67 'saw':201 'say':55 'shed':134 'skin':32 'sleep':199 'sleepless':203 'spoon':51 'squar':224 'stock':77 'stone':140 'stroke':127 'sun':71 'sunset':214 'teeth':35 'thing':179 'thundermug':190 'told':96 'top':158 'wander':110 'wave':49 'wear':75 'weight':149 'went':196 'wild':211 'wild-ey':210 'wilder':231 'without':68 'would':57,123 'yellow':98
1018	Another Night in the Ruins	330		\n1 In the evening haze darkening on the hills,  purple of the eternal,  a last bird crosses over,  ‘flop flop,’ adoring only the instant.     2 Nine years ago, in a plane that rumbled all night  above the Atlantic, I could see, lit up by lightning bolts jumping out of it,  a thunderhead formed like the face of my brother, looking down  on blue, lightning-flashed moments of the Atlantic.     3 He used to tell me, “What good is the day?

Flames bursting out of his brow.     7 How many nights must it take one such as me to learn that we aren’t, after all, made from that bird that flies out of its ashes,  that for us as we go up in flames, our one work is to open ourselves, to be the flames? \n	'1':6 '2':30 '3':76 '4':117 '5':156 '6':174 '7':201 'ador':26 'ago':33 'anoth':1 'aren':216 'ash':229 'atlant':43,75 'bird':21,223 'blue':68 'bolt':51 'bone':173 'bonfir':93 'brother':64 'brow':200 'build':134 'burn':110 'burst':196 'cast':149 'could':45 'cours':106 'cow':164,166 'cross':22 'crow':194 'dark':139 'darken':11 'day':86 'despair':91 'eav':124 'etern':18 'even':9 'face':61 'feather':155 'find':187 'flame':192,195,238,249 'flap':193 'flash':71 'fli':225 'flop':24,25 'flute':130 'form':58 'ghost':129 'ghost-flut':128 'go':235 'good':83 'grain':186 'great':99 'haze':10 'hear':160 'hill':14,89 'hollow':121,169 'ink':153 'ink-spatt':152 'instant':29 'jump':52 'kindl':95 'last':20 'learn':213 'light':97 'lightn':50,70 'lightning-flash':69 'like':59 'listen':158 'lit':47 'look':65 'made':220 'make':108 'mani':203 'moment':72 'moo':170 'must':205 'night':2,40,146,204 'nine':31 'noth':161 'one':208,240 'open':244 'plane':36 'purpl':15 'ravin':143 'rip':189 'rooster':178 'ruin':5,127 'rumbl':38 'see':46 'sky':100 'snow':183 'snowdrift':132 'spatter':154 'sweep':147 'take':207 'tear':119 'tell':80 'though':101 'thrash':180 'throw':114 'thunderhead':57 'true':104 'upsid':141 'upside-down':140 'us':232 'use':78 'wind':118 'wing':150 'work':241 'year':32
1019	The Courtesy	307		\nI walked from my house down Coolidge Street last night  And air, beginning movement in the trees,  Shook down a hushing from the branches.  On either side of me the houses Like solid shadow, blocks of silence In the violet light, so dim without dimming.  And I saw you, Saul, my old friend, waiting  For me at the corner where our two streets met. I wanted to ask you what it was like to die But you said first, as if you didn’t want to tell me,  ‘The doctors made me better. We can run again.’  You ran behind me (the way you always did), Your slow strides lunging; though they never could keep up  This time they stayed right there at my heels.  Turning, I saw one pocket inside out Clapping on your coat front like a white hand.  Your breath quickened, scrawled in the chilling air  Like mine, and vanishing. We ran on a field of snow.  Our footsteps pattered the smooth crust,  Each one feeling like it might break through.  Around us the pure white kindled under violet. And we returned by train. Sitting next to you, Staring through the window, I saw your body Lying like a dark slash in the snow, Your arms flung up, your legs crossed, Even as I heard you next to me Still struggling to catch your breath. You were just  Pretending to be alive—remembering to breathe.  Lumbering under living weight, saying you were cured,  Your flushed cheeks—all just to put me at my ease,  Afraid that your death might embarrass me, even then  Saul, you were more a friend to me than you were dead.  But in my mind the question was still circling: What is it like to die? But how could I catch you In a lie which you intended as a kindness? Beside you on the train, hurtling back Into the strange familiarity of Coolidge Street, Remaining silent, I returned the courtesy.\n	'afraid':260 'air':14,151 'aliv':237 'alway':107 'arm':211 'around':177 'ask':70 'back':317 'begin':15 'behind':102 'besid':311 'better':95 'block':37 'bodi':201 'branch':26 'break':175 'breath':145,230,240 'catch':228,300 'cheek':251 'chill':150 'circl':289 'clap':135 'coat':138 'coolidg':9,323 'corner':61 'could':116,298 'courtesi':2,330 'cross':216 'crust':168 'cure':248 'dark':205 'dead':280 'death':263 'didn':85 'die':77,295 'dim':45,47 'doctor':92 'eas':259 'either':28 'embarrass':265 'even':217,267 'familiar':321 'feel':171 'field':160 'first':81 'flung':212 'flush':250 'footstep':164 'friend':55,274 'front':139 'hand':143 'heard':220 'heel':127 'hous':7,33 'hurtl':316 'hush':23 'insid':133 'intend':307 'keep':117 'kind':310 'kindl':182 'last':11 'leg':215 'lie':202,304 'light':43 'like':34,75,140,152,172,203,293 'live':243 'lumber':241 'lung':112 'made':93 'met':66 'might':174,264 'mind':284 'mine':153 'movement':16 'never':115 'next':191,222 'night':12 'old':54 'one':131,170 'patter':165 'pocket':132 'pretend':234 'pure':180 'put':255 'question':286 'quicken':146 'ran':101,157 'remain':325 'rememb':238 'return':187,328 'right':123 'run':98 'said':80 'saul':52,269 'saw':50,130,199 'say':245 'scrawl':147 'shadow':36 'shook':20 'side':29 'silenc':39 'silent':326 'sit':190 'slash':206 'slow':110 'smooth':167 'snow':162,209 'solid':35 'stare':194 'stay':122 'still':225,288 'strang':320 'street':10,65,324 'stride':111 'struggl':226 'tell':89 'though':113 'time':120 'train':189,315 'tree':19 'turn':128 'two':64 'us':178 'vanish':155 'violet':42,184 'wait':56 'walk':4 'want':68,87 'way':105 'weight':244 'white':142,181 'window':197 'without':46
1020	The Bear	330		\n         1 In late winter I sometimes glimpse bits of steam   coming up from some fault in the old snow and bend close and see it is lung-colored   and put down my nose and know the chilly, enduring odor of bear.          2 I take a wolf’s rib and whittle it sharp at both ends and coil it up and freeze it in blubber and place it out   on the fairway of the bears. And when it has vanished I move out on the bear tracks, roaming in circles until I come to the first, tentative, dark   splash on the earth. And I set out running, following the splashes of blood wandering over the world. At the cut, gashed resting places I stop and rest, at the crawl-marks where he lay out on his belly to overpass some stretch of bauchy ice I lie out dragging myself forward with bear-knives in my fists.          3 On the third day I begin to starve, at nightfall I bend down as I knew I would   at a turd sopped in blood, and hesitate, and pick it up, and thrust it in my mouth, and gnash it down,   and rise and go on running.          4 On the seventh day, living by now on bear blood alone, I can see his upturned carcass far out ahead, a scraggled,   steamy hulk, the heavy fur riffling in the wind. I come up to him and stare at the narrow-spaced, petty eyes,   the dismayed face laid back on the shoulder, the nostrils flared, catching perhaps the first taint of me as he died. I hack a ravine in his thigh, and eat and drink,   and tear him down his whole length and open him and climb in and close him up after me, against the wind, and sleep.          5 And dream of lumbering flatfooted over the tundra, stabbed twice from within, splattering a trail behind me, splattering it out no matter which way I lurch, no matter which parabola of bear-transcendence,   which dance of solitude I attempt, which gravity-clutched leap, which trudge, which groan.          6 Until one day I totter and fall— fall on this stomach that has tried so hard to keep up,   to digest the blood as it leaked in, to break up and digest the bone itself: and now the breeze   blows over me, blows off the hideous belches of ill-digested bear blood   and rotted stomach and the ordinary, wretched odor of bear, blows across my sore, lolled tongue a song or screech, until I think I must rise up   and dance. And I lie still.          7 I awaken I think. Marshlights reappear, geese come trailing again up the flyway. In her ravine under old snow the dam-bear lies, licking lumps of smeared fur and drizzly eyes into shapes with her tongue. And one hairy-soled trudge stuck out before me, the next groaned out, the next, the next, the rest of my days I spend wandering: wondering what, anyway, was that sticky infusion, that rank flavor of blood, that poetry, by which I lived?\n	'1':3 '2':45 '3':161 '4':208 '5':310 '6':360 '7':447 'across':425 'ahead':228 'alon':219 'anyway':513 'attempt':350 'awaken':449 'back':258 'bauchi':146 'bear':2,44,77,88,156,217,343,412,423,470 'bear-kniv':155 'bear-transcend':342 'begin':167 'behind':326 'belch':407 'belli':140 'bend':23,173 'bit':10 'blood':114,185,218,383,413,522 'blow':400,403,424 'blubber':67 'bone':394 'break':389 'breez':399 'carcass':225 'catch':265 'chilli':40 'circl':92 'climb':297 'close':24,300 'clutch':354 'coil':60 'color':31 'come':13,95,241,455 'crawl':132 'crawl-mark':131 'cut':121 'dam':469 'dam-bear':468 'danc':346,442 'dark':100 'day':165,212,363,507 'die':274 'digest':381,392,411 'dismay':255 'drag':151 'dream':312 'drink':285 'drizzli':478 'earth':104 'eat':283 'end':58 'endur':41 'eye':253,479 'face':256 'fairway':74 'fall':367,368 'far':226 'fault':17 'first':98,268 'fist':160 'flare':264 'flatfoot':315 'flavor':520 'flyway':460 'follow':110 'forward':153 'freez':64 'fur':235,476 'gash':122 'gees':454 'glimps':9 'gnash':199 'go':205 'graviti':353 'gravity-clutch':352 'groan':359,497 'hack':276 'hairi':488 'hairy-sol':487 'hard':376 'heavi':234 'hesit':187 'hideous':406 'hulk':232 'ice':147 'ill':410 'ill-digest':409 'infus':517 'keep':378 'knew':177 'knive':157 'know':38 'laid':257 'late':5 'lay':136 'leak':386 'leap':355 'length':292 'lick':472 'lie':149,445,471 'live':213,528 'loll':428 'lumber':314 'lump':473 'lung':30 'lung-color':29 'lurch':336 'mark':133 'marshlight':452 'matter':332,338 'mouth':197 'move':84 'must':438 'narrow':250 'narrow-spac':249 'next':496,500,502 'nightfal':171 'nose':36 'nostril':263 'odor':42,421 'old':20,465 'one':362,486 'open':294 'ordinari':419 'overpass':142 'parabola':340 'perhap':266 'petti':252 'pick':189 'place':69,124 'poetri':524 'put':33 'rank':519 'ravin':278,463 'reappear':453 'rest':123,128,504 'rib':51 'riffl':236 'rise':203,439 'roam':90 'rot':415 'run':109,207 'scraggl':230 'screech':433 'see':26,222 'set':107 'seventh':211 'shape':481 'sharp':55 'shoulder':261 'sleep':309 'smear':475 'snow':21,466 'sole':489 'solitud':348 'sometim':8 'song':431 'sop':183 'sore':427 'space':251 'spend':509 'splash':101,112 'splatter':323,328 'stab':319 'stare':246 'starv':169 'steam':12 'steami':231 'sticki':516 'still':446 'stomach':371,416 'stop':126 'stretch':144 'stuck':491 'taint':269 'take':47 'tear':287 'tentat':99 'thigh':281 'think':436,451 'third':164 'thrust':193 'tongu':429,484 'totter':365 'track':89 'trail':325,456 'transcend':344 'tri':374 'trudg':357,490 'tundra':318 'turd':182 'twice':320 'upturn':224 'vanish':82 'wander':115,510 'way':334 'whittl':53 'whole':291 'wind':239,307 'winter':6 'within':322 'wolf':49 'wonder':511 'world':118 'would':179 'wretch':420
1021	After Making Love We Hear Footsteps	330		\nFor I can snore like a bullhorn or play loud music or sit up talking with any reasonably sober Irishman and Fergus will only sink deeper into his dreamless sleep, which goes by all in one flash,   but let there be that heavy breathing or a stifled come-cry anywhere in the house and he will wrench himself awake and make for it on the run—as now, we lie together, after making love, quiet, touching along the length of our bodies,   familiar touch of the long-married, and he appears—in his baseball pajamas, it happens, the neck opening so small he has to screw them on— and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep, his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child. In the half darkness we look at each other and smile and touch arms across this little, startlingly muscled body— this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his making, sleeper only the mortal sounds can sing awake, this blessing love gives again into our arms.\n	'across':154 'along':84 'anywher':57 'appear':99 'arm':153,188 'awak':66,180 'basebal':102 'bless':182 'bodi':89,159 'breath':50 'bullhorn':13 'child':139 'come':55 'come-cri':54 'cri':56 'dark':143 'deeper':32 'dreamless':35 'face':131 'familiar':90 'fergus':28 'flash':43 'flop':118 'footstep':6 'give':184 'gleam':132 'goe':38 'ground':169 'habit':163 'half':142 'happen':105 'hear':5 'heavi':49 'hous':60 'hug':123 'irishman':26 'length':86 'let':45 'lie':77 'like':11 'littl':156 'long':95 'long-marri':94 'look':145 'loud':16 'love':3,81,183 'make':2,68,80,172 'marri':96 'memori':165 'mortal':176 'muscl':158 'music':17 'neck':107 'one':42,161 'open':108 'pajama':103 'play':15 'propel':166 'quiet':82 'reason':24 'run':73 'satisfact':134 'screw':114 'sing':179 'sink':31 'sit':19 'sleep':36,129 'sleeper':173 'small':110 'smile':150 'snore':10 'snuggl':126 'sober':25 'sound':177 'startl':157 'stifl':53 'talk':21 'togeth':78 'touch':83,91,152 'us':121,124 'wrench':64
1022	The Seekonk Woods	330		\nWhen first I walked here I hobbled   along ties set too close together   for a boy to step easily on each.   I thought my stride one day would reach every other and from then on   I would walk in time with the way   toward that Lobachevskian haze   up ahead where the two rails meet.   Here we put down our pennies, dark,   on shined steel; they trembled, fell still;   then the locomotive out of Attleboro rattling its berserk wheel-rods into perfect circles,   brightened them into wafers, the way a fork   mashes into view the inner light of a carrot   in a stew. In this late March sunshine,   crossing the trees at the angle of a bow   when it effleurages out of the chanterelle   the C three octaves above middle C,   the vertical birthwood remembers   its ascent lines, shrunken by half, exactly   back down, each tree on its fallen summer.   Back then, these rocks often asked   blood offerings—but this one, once, asked bone,   the time Billy Wallace tripped and broke out his front teeth. Fitted with gold replicas, he asked, speaking more brightly, “What good   are golden teeth, given what we’ve got to eat?” Nebuchadnezzar spent seven years down on all fours   eating vetch and alfalfa, ruminating the mouth-feel of “bloom” and “wither,”   until he was whole. If you held a grass blade between both thumbs   and blew hard you could blurt a shriek   out of it—like that beseeching leaves oaks   didn’t drop last winter just now scratch   on a breeze. Maybe Billy, lured by bones’ memory, comes back sometimes, too, to the Seekonk Woods,   to stand in the past and just look at it. Here he might kneel, studying this clump of grass, as a god might inspect the strands of a human sneeze   that percusses through. Or he might stray   into the now untrafficked whistling-lanes   of the mourning doves, who used to call and call   into the future, and give a start, as though,   this very minute, by awful coincidence,   they reach it. And at last traipse off down the tracks, with arrhythmic gait,   as wanderers must do once they realize:   the over-the-unknown route, too, ends up   where time wants. On this spot I skinned the muskrat. The musk breezed away.   I buried the rat. Of the fur I made a hat, which as soon as put on   began to rot off, causing my scalp to crawl.   In circles, of course, keeping to the skull. One day could this scrap of damp skin crawl all the way off, and the whole organism   follow? To do what? Effuse with musk,   or rot with rat? When, a quarter- turn after the sun, the half-moon,   too, goes down and we find ourselves   in the night's night, then somewhere   hereabouts in the dark must be death.   Knowledge of it beforehand is surely among   existence’s most spectacular feats—and yet right here,   on this ordinary afternoon, in these woods,   with a name meaning “black goose” in Wampanoag,   or in modern Seekonkese, “slob blowing fat nose,” this unlikely event happens—a creature   walking the tracks knows it will come.   Then too long to touch every tie, his stride   is now just too short to reach every other, and so he is to be still the wanderer, the hirtle   of too much replaced by the common limp   of too little. But he almost got there. Almost stepped in consonance with the liturgical,   sleeping gods’ snores you can hear humming up from former times inside the ties. He almost   set foot in that border zone where what follows   blows back, shimmering everything, making   walking like sleepwalking, railroad tracks   a country lane on a spring morning,   on which a man, limping but blissful,   makes his way homeward, his lips, suppled   by kissing to bunch up like that, blowing these short strands of hollowed-out air,   haunted by future, into a tune on the tracks.   I think I’m about to be shocked awake. As I was in childhood, when I battered myself   back to my senses against a closed door, or woke up hanging out of an upstairs window.   Somnambulism was my attempt to slip under cover of nightmare across no father’s land   and embrace a phantasm. If only I had found a way to enter his hard time   served at labor by day, by night in solitary,   and put my arms around him in reality,   I might not now be remaking him in memory still; anti-alchemizing bass kettle’s   golden reverberations back down to hair, flesh, blood, bone, the base metals.   I want to crawl face down in the fields and graze on the wild strawberries, my clothes   stained pink, even for seven years   if I must, if they exist. I want to lie out on my back under the thousand stars and think   my way up among them, through them,   and a little distance past them, and attain   a moment of absolute ignorance, if I can, if human mentality lets us. I have always intended to live forever; but not until now, to live now. The moment   I have done one or the other, I here swear,   no one will have to drag me , I’ll come   but never will I agree to burn my words. The poplar logs creosoted asleep under the tracks   have stopped snoring. Maybe they’ve   already waked up. The bow saws at G.   An oak leaf rattles on its tree. The rails   may never meet, O fellow Euclideans,   for you, for me. So what if we groan.   That’s our noise. Laughter is our stuttering   in a language we can’t speak yet. Behind,   the world made of wishes goes dark. Ahead,   if not now then never, shines what is.\n	'absolut':839 'across':712 'afternoon':501 'agre':889 'ahead':52,964 'air':657 'alchem':762 'alfalfa':211 'almost':576,579,601 'along':11

1023	Astronomy Lesson	307		\nThe two boys lean out on the railing   of the front porch, looking up. Behind them they can hear their mother   in one room watching “Name That Tune,”   their father in another watching   a Walter Cronkite Special, the TVs   turned up high and higher till they   each can’t hear the other’s show.   The older boy is saying that no matter   how many stars you counted there were   always more stars beyond them   and beyond the stars black space   going on forever in all directions,   so that even if you flew up millions and millions of years   you’d be no closer to the end   of it than they were now here on the porch on Tuesday night   in the middle of summer. The younger boy can think somehow   only of his mother’s closet,   how he likes to crawl in back   behind the heavy drapery of shirts, nightgowns and dresses,   into the sheer black where no matter how close he holds   his hand up to his face there’s no hand ever, no face to hold it to. A woman from another street is calling to her stray cat or dog,   clapping and whistling it in, and farther away deep in the city   sirens now and again veer in and out of hearing. The boys edge closer, shoulder   to shoulder now, sad Ptolemies, the older looking up, the younger as he thinks back straight ahead into the black leaves of the maple where the street lights flicker like another watery skein of stars. “Name That Tune” and Walter Cronkite struggle like rough water to rise above each other. And the woman now comes walking in a nightgown down the middle of the street, clapping and whistling, while the older boy goes on about what light years are, and solar winds, black holes, and how the sun is cooling and what will happen to them all when it is cold.\n	'ahead':239 'alway':72 'anoth':34,186,253 'astronomi':1 'away':203 'back':145,237 'behind':17,146 'beyond':75,78 'black':81,158,242,305 'boy':5,59,129,219,294 'call':189 'cat':193 'citi':207 'clap':196,288 'close':163 'closer':105,221 'closet':138 'cold':323 'come':277 'cool':312 'count':69 'crawl':143 'cronkit':38,263 'd':102 'deep':204 'direct':88 'dog':195 'draperi':149 'dress':154 'edg':220 'end':108 'even':91 'ever':176 'face':171,178 'farther':202 'father':32 'flew':94 'flicker':251 'forev':85 'front':13 'go':83 'goe':295 'hand':167,175 'happen':316 'hear':21,52,217 'heavi':148 'high':44 'higher':46 'hold':165,180 'hole':306 'lean':6 'leav':243 'lesson':2 'light':250,299 'like':141,252,265 'look':15,230 'mani':66 'mapl':246 'matter':64,161 'middl':124,284 'million':96,98 'mother':23,136 'name':28,258 'night':121 'nightgown':152,281 'older':58,229,293 'one':25 'porch':14,118 'ptolemi':227 'rail':10 'rise':269 'room':26 'rough':266 'sad':226 'say':61 'sheer':157 'shirt':151 'shoulder':222,224 'show':56 'siren':208 'skein':255 'solar':303 'somehow':132 'space':82 'special':39 'star':67,74,80,257 'straight':238 'stray':192 'street':187,249,287 'struggl':264 'summer':126 'sun':310 'think':131,236 'till':47 'tuesday':120 'tune':30,260 'turn':42 'tvs':41 'two':4 'veer':212 'walk':278 'walter':37,262 'watch':27,35 'water':267 'wateri':254 'whistl':198,290 'wind':304 'woman':184,275 'year':100,300 'younger':128,233

1025	Vapor Trail Reflected in the Frog Pond	330		\n1 The old watch: their thick eyes puff and foreclose by the moon. The young, heads  trailed by the beginnings of necks, shiver, in the guarantee they shall be bodies. In the frog pond the vapor trail of a SAC bomber creeps, I hear its drone, drifting, high up  in immaculate ozone.          2 And I hear, coming over the hills, America singing, her varied carols I hear: crack of deputies' rifles practicing their aim on stray dogs at night,  sput of cattleprod, TV going on about the smells of the human body, curses of the soldier as he poisons, burns, grinds, and stabs  the rice of the world, with open mouth, crying strong, hysterical curses.          3 And by paddies in Asia bones wearing a few shadows walk down a dirt road, smashed  bloodsuckers on their heel, knowing  flesh thrown down in the sunshine  dogs shall eat and flesh flung into the air shall be seized by birds, shoulder blades smooth, unmarked by old feather-holes,  hands rivered by blue, erratic wanderings of the blood,  eyes crinkled shut at almost seeing  the drifting sun that gives us our lives.\n	'1':8 '2':60 '3':123 'aim':81 'air':159 'almost':187 'america':68 'asia':128 'begin':27 'bird':164 'blade':166 'blood':182 'bloodsuck':140 'blue':177 'bodi':37,99 'bomber':48 'bone':129 'burn':107 'carol':72 'cattleprod':89 'come':64 'crack':75 'creep':49 'cri':119 'crinkl':184 'curs':100,122 'deputi':77 'dirt':137 'dog':84,151 'drift':54,190 'drone':53 'eat':153 'errat':178 'eye':14,183 'feather':172 'feather-hol':171 'flesh':145,155 'flung':156 'foreclos':17 'frog':6,40 'give':193 'go':91 'grind':108 'guarante':33 'hand':174 'head':23 'hear':51,63,74 'heel':143 'high':55 'hill':67 'hole':173 'human':98 'hyster':121 'immacul':58 'know':144 'live':196 'moon':20 'mouth':118 'neck':29 'night':86 'old':10,170 'open':117 'ozon':59 'paddi':126 'poison':106 'pond':7,41 'practic':79 'puff':15 'reflect':3 'rice':112 'rifl':78 'river':175 'road':138 'sac':47 'see':188 'seiz':162 'shadow':133 'shall':35,152,160 'shiver':30 'shoulder':165 'shut':185 'sing':69 'smash':139 'smell':95 'smooth':167 'soldier':103 'sput':87 'stab':110 'stray':83 'strong':120 'sun':191 'sunshin':150 'thick':13 'thrown':146 'trail':2,24,44 'tv':90 'unmark':168 'us':194 'vapor':1,43 'vari':71 'walk':134 'wander':179 'watch':11 'wear':130 'world':115 'young':22
1026	The Man Splitting Wood in the Daybreak	330		\nThe man splitting wood in the daybreak  looks strong, as though, if one weakened,  one could turn to him and he would help.  Gus Newland was strong. When he split wood  he struck hard, flashing the bright steel  through the air so hard the hard maple  leapt apart, as it’s feared marriages will do  in countries reluctant to permit divorce,  and even willow, which, though stacked  to dry a full year, on being split actually weeps—totem wood, therefore,  to the married-until-death—sunders  with many little lip-wetting gasp-noises. But Gus is dead. We could turn to our fathers,  but they help us only by the unperplexed  looking-back of the numerals cut into headstones.  Or to our mothers, whose love, so devastated,  can’t, even in spring, break through the hard earth.  Our spouses weaken at the same rate we do.  We have to hold our children up to lean on them.  Everyone who could help goes or hasn’t arrived.  What about the man splitting wood in the daybreak,  who looked strong? That was years ago. That was me.\n	'actual':83 'ago':193 'air':48 'apart':55 'arriv':177 'back':124 'break':144 'bright':44 'children':163 'could':23,109,171 'countri':64 'cut':128 'daybreak':7,14,186 'dead':107 'death':93 'devast':138 'divorc':68 'dri':76 'earth':148 'even':70,141 'everyon':169 'father':113 'fear':59 'flash':42 'full':78 'gasp':102 'gasp-nois':101 'goe':173 'gus':31,105 'hard':41,50,52,147 'hasn':175 'headston':130 'help':30,116,172 'hold':161 'lean':166 'leapt':54 'lip':99 'lip-wet':98 'littl':97 'look':15,123,188 'looking-back':122 'love':136 'man':2,9,181 'mani':96 'mapl':53 'marri':91 'marriag':60 'married-until-death':90 'mother':134 'newland':32 'nois':103 'numer':127 'one':20,22 'permit':67 'rate':155 'reluct':65 'split':3,10,37,82,182 'spous':150 'spring':143 'stack':74 'steel':45 'strong':16,34,189 'struck':40 'sunder':94 'therefor':87 'though':18,73 'totem':85 'turn':24,110 'unperplex':121 'us':117 'weaken':21,151 'weep':84 'wet':100 'whose':135 'willow':71 'wood':4,11,38,86,183 'would':29 'year':79,192
1027	Flower Herding on Mount Monadnock	330		\n1 I can support it no longer.  Laughing ruefully at myself  For all I claim to have suffered  I get up. Damned nightmarer! It is New Hampshire out here, It is nearly the dawn. The song of the whippoorwill stops And the dimension of depth seizes everything. 2 The whistles of a peabody bird go overhead  Like a needle pushed five times through the air,  They enter the leaves, and come out little changed. The air is so still That as they go off through the trees The love songs of birds do not get any fainter. 3 The last memory I have Is of a flower that cannot be touched, Through the bloom of which, all day,  Fly crazed, missing bees. 4 As I climb sweat gets up my nostrils,  For an instant I think I am at the sea, One summer off Cap Ferrat we watched a black seagull  Straining for the dawn, we stood in the surf, Grasshoppers splash up where I step, The mountain laurel crashes at my thighs. 5 There is something joyous in the elegies  Of birds. They seem Caught up in a formal delight, Though the mourning dove whistles of despair. But at last in the thousand elegies The dead rise in our hearts, On the brink of our happiness we stop  Like someone on a drunk starting to weep. 6 I kneel at a pool, I look through my face At the bacteria I think I see crawling through the moss. My face sees me, The water stirs, the face,  Looking preoccupied, Gets knocked from its bones. 7 I weighed eleven pounds At birth, having stayed on Two extra weeks in the womb.  Tempted by room and fresh air  I came out big as a policeman  Blue-faced, with narrow red eyes.  It was eight days before the doctor  Would scare my mother with me. Turning and craning in the vines  I can make out through the leaves The old, shimmering nothingness, the sky. 8 Green, scaly moosewoods ascend,  Tenants of the shaken paradise, At every wind last night’s rain  Comes splattering from the leaves, It drops in flurries and lies there,  The footsteps of some running start. 9 From a rock A waterfall, A single trickle like a strand of wire,  Breaks into beads halfway down. I know The birds fly off But the hug of the earth wraps With moss their graves and the giant boulders. 10 In the forest I discover a flower. The invisible life of the thing Goes up in flames that are invisible,  Like cellophane burning in the sunlight. It burns up. Its drift is to be nothing. In its covertness it has a way Of uttering itself in place of itself, Its blossoms claim to float in the Empyrean, A wrathful presence on the blur of the ground. The appeal to heaven breaks off. The petals begin to fall, in self-forgiveness. It is a flower. On this mountainside it is dying.\n	'1':6 '10':414 '2':53 '3':103 '4':128 '5':179 '6':233 '7':271 '8':339 '9':374 'air':70,81,292 'appeal':482 'ascend':343 'bacteria':246 'bead':390 'bee':127 'begin':489 'big':296 'bird':59,97,188,396 'birth':277 'black':155 'bloom':119 'blossom':465 'blue':301 'blue-fac':300 'blur':477 'bone':270 'boulder':413 'break':388,485 'brink':219 'burn':437,442 'came':294 'cannot':114 'cap':150 'caught':191 'cellophan':436 'chang':79 'claim':20,466 'climb':131 'come':76,356 'covert':452 'crane':322 'crash':175 'crawl':251 'craze':125 'damn':27 'dawn':39,160 'day':123,310 'dead':212 'delight':196 'depth':50 'despair':203 'die':505 'dimens':48 'discov':419 'doctor':313 'dove':200 'drift':445 'drop':362 'drunk':229 'earth':404 'eight':309 'elegi':186,210 'eleven':274 'empyrean':471 'enter':72 'everi':350 'everyth':52 'extra':282 'eye':306 'face':243,256,263,302 'fainter':102 'fall':491 'ferrat':151 'five':66 'flame':431 'fli':124,397 'float':468 'flower':1,112,421,499 'flurri':364 'footstep':369 'forest':417 'forgiv':495 'formal':195 'fresh':291 'get':25,100,133,266 'giant':412 'go':60,88 'goe':428 'grasshopp':166 'grave':409 'green':340 'ground':480 'halfway':391 'hampshir':32 'happi':222 'heart':216 'heaven':484 'herd':2 'hug':401 'instant':139 'invis':423,434 'joyous':183 'kneel':235 'knock':267 'know':394 'last':105,206,352 'laugh':13 'laurel':174 'leav':74,332,360 'lie':366 'life':424 'like':62,225,383,435 'littl':78 'longer':12 'look':240,264 'love':94 'make':328 'memori':106 'miss':126 'monadnock':5 'moosewood':342 'moss':254,407 'mother':317 'mount':4 'mountain':173 'mountainsid':502 'mourn':199 'narrow':304 'near':37 'needl':64 'new':31 'night':353 'nightmar':28 'nostril':136 'noth':449 'nothing':336 'old':334 'one':147 'overhead':61 'paradis':348 'peabodi':58 'petal':488 'place':461 'policeman':299 'pool':238 'pound':275 'preoccupi':265 'presenc':474 'push':65 'rain':355 'red':305 'rise':213 'rock':377 'room':289 'ruefulli':14 'run':372 'scali':341 'scare':315 'sea':146 'seagul':156 'see':250,257 'seem':190 'seiz':51 'self':494 'self-forg':493 'shaken':347 'shimmer':335 'singl':381 'sky':338 'someon':226 'someth':182 'song':41,95 'splash':167 'splatter':357 'start':230,373 'stay':279 'step':171 'still':84 'stir':261 'stood':162 'stop':45,224 'strain':157 'strand':385 'suffer':23 'summer':148 'sunlight':440 'support':9 'surf':165 'sweat':132 'tempt':287 'tenant':344 'thigh':178 'thing':427 'think':141,248 'though':197 'thousand':209 'time':67 'touch':116 'tree':92 'trickl':382 'turn':320 'two':281 'utter':458 'vine':325 'watch':153 'water':260 'waterfal':379 'way':456 'week':283 'weep':232 'weigh':273 'whippoorwil':44 'whistl':55,201 'wind':351 'wire':387 'womb':286 'would':314 'wrap':405 'wrath':473
1028	Rapture	330		\nI can feel she has got out of bed.   That means it is seven a.m. I have been lying with eyes shut,   thinking, or possibly dreaming, of how she might look if, at breakfast,   I spoke about the hidden place in her   which, to me, is like a soprano’s tremolo, and right then, over toast and bramble jelly, if such things are possible, she came. I imagine she would show it while trying to conceal it. I imagine her hair would fall about her face and she would become apparently downcast, as she does at a concert when she is moved. The hypnopompic play passes, and I open my eyes and there she is, next to the bed,   bending to a low drawer, picking over   various small smooth black, white, and pink items of underwear. She bends   so low her back runs parallel to the earth, but there is no sway in it, there is little burden, the day has hardly begun. The two mounds of muscles for walking, leaping, lovemaking, lift toward the east—what can I say? Simile is useless; there is nothing like them on earth. Her breasts fall full; the nipples are deep pink in the glare shining up through the iron bars of the gate under the earth where those who could not love press, wanting to be born again.   I reach out and take her wrist and she falls back into bed and at once starts unbuttoning my pajamas.   Later, when I open my eyes, there she is again,   rummaging in the same low drawer.   The clock shows eight. Hmmm.   With huge, silent effort of great, mounded muscles the earth has been turning. She takes a piece of silken cloth from the drawer and stands up. Under the falls   of hair her face has become quiet and downcast,   as if she will be, all day among strangers,   looking down inside herself at our rapture.\n	'a.m':16 'among':314 'appar':92 'back':143,238 'bar':209 'becom':91,303 'bed':10,120,240 'begun':164 'bend':121,139 'black':131 'born':226 'brambl':59 'breakfast':35 'breast':193 'burden':159 'came':67 'clock':265 'cloth':288 'conceal':77 'concert':99 'could':219 'day':161,313 'deep':199 'downcast':93,306 'drawer':125,263,291 'dream':27 'earth':148,191,215,278 'east':177 'effort':272 'eight':267 'eye':22,112,253 'face':87,301 'fall':84,194,237,297 'feel':4 'full':195 'gate':212 'glare':203 'got':7 'great':274 'hair':82,299 'hard':163 'hidden':40 'hmmm':268 'huge':270 'hypnopomp':105 'imagin':69,80 'insid':318 'iron':208 'item':135 'jelli':60 'later':248 'leap':172 'lie':20 'lift':174 'like':48,188 'littl':158 'look':32,316 'love':221 'lovemak':173 'low':124,141,262 'mean':12 'might':31 'mound':167,275 'move':103 'muscl':169,276 'next':117 'nippl':197 'noth':187 'open':110,251 'pajama':247 'parallel':145 'pass':107 'pick':126 'piec':285 'pink':134,200 'place':41 'play':106 'possibl':26,65 'press':222 'quiet':304 'raptur':1,322 'reach':229 'right':54 'rummag':258 'run':144 'say':181 'seven':15 'shine':204 'show':72,266 'shut':23 'silent':271 'silken':287 'simil':182 'small':129 'smooth':130 'soprano':50 'spoke':37 'stand':293 'start':244 'stranger':315 'sway':153 'take':232,283 'thing':63 'think':24 'toast':57 'toward':175 'tremolo':52 'tri':75 'turn':281 'two':166 'unbutton':245 'underwear':137 'useless':184 'various':128 'walk':171 'want':223 'white':132 'would':71,83,90 'wrist':234
1029	The Vacuum	309		\nThe house is so quiet now The vacuum cleaner sulks in the corner closet,  Its bag limp as a stopped lung, its mouth  Grinning into the floor, maybe at my Slovenly life, my dog-dead youth. I’ve lived this way long enough, But when my old woman died her soul Went into that vacuum cleaner, and I can’t bear  To see the bag swell like a belly, eating the dust  And the woolen mice, and begin to howl Because there is old filth everywhere She used to crawl, in the corner and under the stair.  I know now how life is cheap as dirt,  And still the hungry, angry heart  Hangs on and howls, biting at air.\n	'air':122 'angri':114 'bag':18,68 'bear':64 'begin':81 'belli':72 'bite':120 'cheap':107 'cleaner':11,59 'closet':16 'corner':15,96 'crawl':93 'dead':38 'die':52 'dirt':109 'dog':37 'dog-dead':36 'dust':75 'eat':73 'enough':46 'everywher':89 'filth':88 'floor':29 'grin':26 'hang':116 'heart':115 'hous':4 'howl':83,119 'hungri':113 'know':102 'life':34,105 'like':70 'limp':19 'live':42 'long':45 'lung':23 'mayb':30 'mice':79 'mouth':25 'old':50,87 'quiet':7 'see':66 'sloven':33 'soul':54 'stair':100 'still':111 'stop':22 'sulk':12 'swell':69 'use':91 'vacuum':2,10,58 've':41 'way':44 'went':55 'woman':51 'woolen':78 'youth':39

1031	I Only Am Escaped Alone to Tell Thee	309		\nI tell you that I see her still At the dark entrance of the hall. One gas lamp burning near her shoulder  Shone also from her other side  Where hung the long inaccurate glass  Whose pictures were as troubled water.  An immense shadow had its hand  Between us on the floor, and seemed  To hump the knuckles nervously,  A giant crab readying to walk,  Or a blanket moving in its sleep. You will remember, with a smile  Instructed by movies to reminisce,  How strict her corsets must have been,  How the huge arrangements of her hair  Would certainly betray the least  Impassionate displacement there.  It was no rig for dallying, And maybe only marriage could  Derange that queenly scaffolding— As when a great ship, coming home,  Coasts in the harbor, dropping sail And loosing all the tackle that had laced Her in the long lanes ....                                        I know We need not draw this figure out. But all that whalebone came from whales.  And all the whales lived in the sea,  In calm beneath the troubled glass,  Until the needle drew their blood. I see her standing in the hall, Where the mirror’s lashed to blood and foam,  And the black flukes of agony Beat at the air till the light blows out.\n	'agoni':211 'air':215 'alon':5 'also':32 'arrang':101 'beat':212 'beneath':180 'betray':107 'black':208 'blanket':75 'blood':189,203 'blow':219 'burn':27 'calm':179 'came':167 'certain':106 'coast':135 'come':133 'corset':94 'could':123 'crab':69 'dalli':118 'dark':19 'derang':124 'displac':111 'draw':159 'drew':187 'drop':139 'entranc':20 'escap':4 'figur':161 'floor':59 'fluke':209 'foam':205 'gas':25 'giant':68 'glass':42,183 'great':131 'hair':104 'hall':23,196 'hand':54 'harbor':138 'home':134 'huge':100 'hump':63 'hung':38 'immens':50 'impassion':110 'inaccur':41 'instruct':86 'know':155 'knuckl':65 'lace':148 'lamp':26 'lane':153 'lash':201 'least':109 'light':218 'live':174 'long':40,152 'loos':142 'marriag':122 'mayb':120 'mirror':199 'move':76 'movi':88 'must':95 'near':28 'need':157 'needl':186 'nervous':66 'one':24 'pictur':44 'queen':126 'readi':70 'rememb':82 'reminisc':90 'rig':116 'sail':140 'scaffold':127 'sea':177 'see':14,191 'seem':61 'shadow':51 'ship':132 'shone':31 'shoulder':30 'side':36 'sleep':79 'smile':85 'stand':193 'still':16 'strict':92 'tackl':145 'tell':7,10 'thee':8 'till':216 'troubl':47,182 'us':56 'walk':72 'water':48 'whale':169,173 'whalebon':166 'whose':43 'would':105
1032	Happy Hour	307		\nThe gregarious dark is shifting  when she puts her second drink,  the free one, half on the coaster.  The tipped wine poised at the brim  is the beginning of the bad girl  she’ll promise never to be again  tomorrow, who can taunt him now  to prove he doesn’t love her and never could: her hand slides  up his thigh until he tenses— ‘My little prig, don’t you want  to fuck me?’ the bad girl she couldn’t be at home, his wife on ice.  All he can do is smile back as though she’s made a harmless  good-natured joke, and struggle  not to look around to see who’s heard, who’s watching. He wants  to smash the wine glass in her face  so he can know for once exactly what he’s done wrong;  but he places it instead back safely on the coaster quickly before she sees. Never cautious enough, he is prepared  even if she knocks it over to go down on his hands and knees  and wipe it up, kind and forgiving.  In all ways careful to acquit himself  so that tomorrow when she says she doesn’t deserve him, he’s too good,  he can believe her. Tomorrow  will be his happy hour.

1033	The Murder of William Remington	309		\nIt is true, that even in the best-run state  Such things will happen; it is true, What’s done is done. The law, whereby we hate  Our hatred, sees no fire in the flue But by the smoke, and not for thought alone  It punishes, but for the thing that’s done. And yet there is the horror of the fact,  Though we knew not the man. To die in jail,  To be beaten to death, to know the act  Of personal fury before the eyes can fail  And the man die against the cold last wall  Of the lonely world—and neither is that all: There is the terror too of each man’s thought,  That knows not, but must quietly suspect  His neighbor, friend, or self of being taught  To take an attitude merely correct;  Being frightened of his own cold image in  The glass of government, and his own sin, Frightened lest senate house and prison wall Be quarried of one stone, lest righteous and high  Look faintly smiling down and seem to call  A crime the welcome chance of liberty,  And any man an outlaw who aggrieves  The patriotism of a pair of thieves.\n	'act':87 'aggriev':198 'alon':50 'attitud':142 'beaten':81 'best':14 'best-run':13 'call':184 'chanc':189 'cold':102,150 'correct':144 'crime':186 'death':83 'die':76,99 'done':26,28,59 'even':10 'eye':93 'fact':68 'fail':95 'faint':178 'fire':38 'flue':41 'friend':133 'frighten':146,161 'furi':90 'glass':154 'govern':156 'happen':20 'hate':33 'hatr':35 'high':176 'horror':65 'hous':164 'imag':151 'jail':78 'knew':71 'know':85,125 'last':103 'law':30 'lest':162,173 'liberti':191 'lone':107 'look':177 'man':74,98,121,194 'mere':143 'murder':2 'must':128 'neighbor':132 'neither':110 'one':171 'outlaw':196 'pair':203 'patriot':200 'person':89 'prison':166 'punish':52 'quarri':169 'quiet':129 'remington':5 'righteous':174 'run':15 'see':36 'seem':182 'self':135 'senat':163 'sin':160 'smile':179 'smoke':45 'state':16 'stone':172 'suspect':130 'take':140 'taught':138 'terror':117 'thiev':205 'thing':18,56 'though':69 'thought':49,123 'true':8,23 'wall':104,167 'welcom':188 'wherebi':31 'william':4 'world':108 'yet':61
1034	Manufacturing	307		\nUp in the billboard, over old South Station,  the Captain, all wide grin and ruddy cheek,  held up a golden shot of Cutty Sark high as the skyline where the sunset spread a gold fan from the twig-like spars and rigging  of a departing clipper ship. Above the picture the dull haze of a real sun rose,  dragging the day up with it. Seven o’clock.  The agitated horns, brakes, fingers, and catcalls  down below me were already merging  and channeling everybody on to warehouse,  factory, department store and office. My father and uncle talking over all the goods  to be received that day, the goods delivered,  their two reflections in the window floating  like blurry ghosts within the Captain’s grin,  their voices raised a little above the soft  erratic humming of the big machines,  the riveters and pressers, warming, rousing:  The Century order, did it get out last night?  And had the buckles come from Personal?  Who’d go do Jaffey? Who’d diddle Abramowitz  and Saperstein? Those cocksucking sons of bitches,  cut their balls off if they fuck with us . . . How automatically at any provocation  I can aim the words at anybody now, woman or man, the reverberating angry this, not that, in ‘pussy’, ‘cocksucker’,  ‘fuckhead’, hammered down so far inside me  it’s almost too securely there to feel. But I was thirteen then, and for the first  time old enough to have my father say these things in front of me, which must have meant  I was a man now too, I listened (blushing,  ashamed of blushing) for clues of what it was  I had become, or was supposed to be: It did and didn’t have to do with bodies,  being a man, it wasn’t fixed in bodies, but somehow passed between them, going to  by being taken from, ever departing,  ever arriving, unstoppable as money,  and moving in a limited supply  it seemed to follow where the money went.  Being a man was something that you did  to other men, which meant a woman was what other men became when you would do them.  Either you gave a fucking, or you took one,  did or were done to, it was simple as that. Somebody shouted from beyond the office  that Tony had passed out in the can again.  ‘The lush, the no good lush,’ my uncle said,  ‘get him the fuck out of here for good, will ya.’ The stall door swung back, scrawled with giant cocks,  tits, asses and cunts, beyond which in the shadows  my father was gently wrestling with the man,  trying to hold him steady while his free hand  shimmied the tangled shorts and trousers up  over the knees and hips, and even got the shirt tucked in, the pants zipped deftly enough  for Tony not to notice, though he did. Even then I knew they’d fire him, and that it wasn’t gratitude at all that made the man weep inconsolably, his head bowed, nodding, as my father led him  to the elevator, still with his arm around him,  patting his shoulder, easing him through the door.  I knew the tenderness that somewhere else  could possibly have been a lover’s or a father’s  could here be only an efficient way to minimize the trouble. And yet it seemed  somehow my father was too adept at it,  too skillful, not to feel it in some way. And feeling it not to need to pull back,  to separate himself from what the rest of him was doing, which was why, I think, his face throughout was blank, expressionless like the faces of the presidents on the bills  he handed Tony as the door slid shut.  The men fast at the riveters and pressers  and the long row of women at the Singers  were oil now even more than men or women,  mute oil in the loud revving of the place,  a blur of hands on automatic pilot, slipping leather through the pumping needles, under the thrusting rods, the furious hammers,  the nearly invisible whirring of the blades.  ‘Come on now, Al, it’s time,’ my father said,  and the Captain seemed to grin a little wider,  as if his pleasure there at the end of his  unending day grew freer, more disencumbered,  because he saw me at the start of mine,  under my father’s arm, his soft voice broken  against the noise into an unfollowable tune  of favors and petty cash, and how much ass  he had to kiss to get me this, and I should be a man now and not disappoint him.\n	'abramowitz':170 'adept':563 'agit':71 'aim':194 'al':688 'almost':221 'alreadi':81 'angri':205 'anybodi':198 'arm':514,733 'around':515 'arriv':313 'asham':263 'ass':420,753 'automat':188,663 'back':414,583 'ball':180 'becam':350 'becom':274 'beyond':378,423 'big':138 'bill':614 'billboard':5 'bitch':177 'blade':684 'blank':604 'blur':659 'blurri':119 'blush':262,265 'bodi':289,298 'bow':501 'brake':73 'broken':737 'buckl':158 'captain':11,123,697 'cash':749 'catcal':76 'centuri':147 'channel':84 'cheek':17 'clipper':48 'clock':69 'clue':267 'cock':418 'cocksuck':174,211 'come':159,685 'could':532,543 'cunt':422 'cut':178 'cutti':24 'd':163,168,482 'day':63,107,715 'deft':467 'deliv':110 'depart':47,90,311 'diddl':169 'didn':283 'disappoint':771 'disencumb':719 'done':368 'door':412,524,620 'drag':61 'dull':54 'eas':520 'effici':548 'either':356 'elev':510 'els':531 'end':711 'enough':238,468 'errat':134 'even':458,477,643 'ever':310,312 'everybodi':85 'expressionless':605 'face':601,608 'factori':89 'fan':36 'far':216 'fast':625 'father':95,242,429,505,541,560,693,731 'favor':746 'feel':226,570,576 'finger':74 'fire':483 'first':235 'fix':296 'float':117 'follow':326 'free':443 'freer':717 'front':247 'fuck':184,360,402 'fuckhead':212 'furious':676 'gave':358 'gentl':431 'get':151,399,759 'ghost':120 'giant':417 'go':164,304 'gold':35 'golden':21 'good':102,109,394,407 'got':459 'gratitud':490 'grew':716 'grin':14,125,700 'hammer':213,677 'hand':444,616,661 'haze':55 'head':500 'held':18 'high':26 'hip':456 'hold':438 'horn':72 'hum':135 'inconsol':498 'insid':217 'invis':680 'jaffey':166 'kiss':757 'knee':454 'knew':480,526 'last':153 'leather':666 'led':506 'like':41,118,606 'limit':321 'listen':261 'littl':130,702 'long':633 'loud':653 'lover':537 'lush':391,395 'machin':139 'made':494 'man':202,257,292,333,435,496,767 'manufactur':1 'meant':253,343 'men':341,349,624,646 'merg':82 'mine':728 'minim':551 'money':316,329 'move':318 'much':752 'must':251 'mute':649 'near':679 'need':580 'needl':670 'night':154 'nod':502 'nois':740 'notic':473 'o':68 'offic':93,380 'oil':641,650 'old':7,237 'one':364 'order':148 'pant':465 'pass':301,384 'pat':517 'person':161 'petti':748 'pictur':52 'pilot':664 'place':657 'pleasur':707 'possibl':533 'presid':611 'presser':143,630 'provoc':191 'pull':582 'pump':669 'pussi':210 'rais':128 'real':58 'receiv':105 'reflect':113 'rest':590 'reverber':204 'revv':654 'rig':44 'rivet':141,628 'rod':674 'rose':60 'rous':145 'row':634 'ruddi':16 'said':398,694 'saperstein':172 'sark':25 'saw':722 'say':243 'scrawl':415 'secur':223 'seem':324,557,698 'separ':585 'seven':67 'shadow':427 'shimmi':445 'ship':49 'shirt':461 'short':448 'shot':22 'shoulder':519 'shout':376 'shut':622 'simpl':372 'singer':639 'skill':567 'skylin':29 'slid':621 'slip':665 'soft':133,735 'somebodi':375 'somehow':300,558 'someth':335 'somewher':530 'son':175 'south':8 'spar':42 'spread':33 'stall':411 'start':726 'station':9 'steadi':440 'still':511 'store':91 'sun':59 'sunset':32 'suppli':322 'suppos':277 'swung':413 'taken':308 'talk':98 'tangl':447 'tender':528 'thing':245 'think':599 'thirteen':230 'though':474 'throughout':602 'thrust':673 'time':236,691 'tit':419 'toni':382,470,617 'took':363 'tri':436 'troubl':553 'trouser':450 'tuck':462 'tune':744 'twig':40 'twig-lik':39 'two':112 'uncl':97,397 'unend':714 'unfollow':743 'unstopp':314 'us':186 'voic':127,736 'warehous':88 'warm':144 'wasn':294,488 'way':549,574 'weep':497 'went':330 'whir':681 'wide':13 'wider':703 'window':116 'within':121 'woman':200,345 'women':636,648 'word':196 'would':353 'wrestl':432 'ya':409 'yet':555 'zip':466
1035	The View from an Attic Window	309		\n1 Among the high-branching, leafless boughs  Above the roof-peaks of the town,  Snowflakes unnumberably come down. I watched out of the attic window  The laced sway of family trees,  Intricate genealogies Whose strict, reserved gentility,  Trembling, impossible to bow,  Received the appalling fall of snow. All during Sunday afternoon,  Not storming, but befittingly,  Out of a still, grey, devout sky, The snowflakes fell, until all shapes Went under, and thickening, drunken lines  Cobwebbed the sleep of solemn pines. Up in the attic, among many things  Inherited and out of style,  I cried, then fell asleep awhile, Waking at night now, as the snow- flakes from darkness to darkness go  Past yellow lights in the street below. 2 I cried because life is hopeless and beautiful.  And like a child I cried myself to sleep High in the head of the house, feeling the hull  Beneath me pitch and roll among the steep  Mountains and valleys of the many years    That brought me to tears. Down in the cellar, furnace and washing machine,  Pump, fuse-box, water heater, work their hearts  Out at my life, which narrowly runs between  Them and this cemetery of spare parts For discontinued men, whose hats and canes     Are my rich remains. And women, their portraits and wedding gowns  Stacked in the corners, brooding in wooden trunks;  And children’s rattles, books about lions and clowns;  And headless, hanging dresses swayed like drunks  Whenever a living footstep shakes the floor;    I mention no more; But what I thought today, that made me cry,  Is this, that we live in two kinds of thing:  The powerful trees, thrusting into the sky Their black patience, are one, and that branching Relation teaches how we endure and grow;     The other is the snow, Falling in a white chaos from the sky,  As many as the sands of all the seas, As all the men who died or who will die, As stars in heaven, as leaves of all the trees;  As Abraham was promised of his seed;    Generations bleed, Till I, high in the tower of my time  Among familiar ruins, began to cry For accident, sickness, justice, war and crime,  Because all died, because I had to die. The snow fell, the trees stood, the promise kept,    And a child I slept.\n	'1':7 '2':127 'abraham':344 'accid':368 'afternoon':59 'among':8,93,160,361 'appal':52 'asleep':105 'attic':5,32,92 'awhil':106 'beauti':135 'befit':63 'began':364 'beneath':155 'black':287 'bleed':351 'book':237 'bough':14 'bow':49 'box':186 'branch':12,293 'brood':229 'brought':171 'cane':213 'cellar':178 'cemeteri':203 'chao':310 'child':139,393 'children':234 'clown':241 'cobweb':83 'come':25 'corner':228 'cri':102,129,141,268,366 'crime':373 'dark':116,118 'devout':69 'die':328,332,376,381 'discontinu':208 'dress':245 'drunk':248 'drunken':81 'endur':298 'fall':53,306 'famili':38 'familiar':362 'feel':152 'fell':73,104,384 'flake':114 'floor':255 'footstep':252 'furnac':179 'fuse':185 'fuse-box':184 'genealog':41 'generat':350 'gentil':45 'go':119 'gown':224 'grey':68 'grow':300 'hang':244 'hat':211 'head':148 'headless':243 'heart':191 'heater':188 'heaven':336 'high':11,145,354 'high-branch':10 'hopeless':133 'hous':151 'hull':154 'imposs':47 'inherit':96 'intric':40 'justic':370 'kept':390 'kind':276 'lace':35 'leafless':13 'leav':338 'life':131,195 'light':122 'like':137,247 'line':82 'lion':239 'live':251,273 'machin':182 'made':266 'mani':94,168,315 'men':209,326 'mention':257 'mountain':163 'narrowli':197 'night':109 'one':290 'part':206 'past':120 'patienc':288 'peak':19 'pine':88 'pitch':157 'portrait':221 'power':280 'promis':346,389 'pump':183 'rattl':236 'receiv':50 'relat':294 'remain':217 'reserv':44 'rich':216 'roll':159 'roof':18 'roof-peak':17 'ruin':363 'run':198 'sand':318 'sea':322 'seed':349 'shake':253 'shape':76 'sick':369 'sky':70,285,313 'sleep':85,144 'slept':395 'snow':55,113,305,383 'snowflak':23,72 'solemn':87 'spare':205 'stack':225 'star':334 'steep':162 'still':67 'stood':387 'storm':61 'street':125 'strict':43 'style':100 'sunday':58 'sway':36,246 'teach':295 'tear':174 'thicken':80 'thing':95,278 'thought':263 'thrust':282 'till':352 'time':360 'today':264 'tower':357 'town':22 'tree':39,281,342,386 'trembl':46 'trunk':232 'two':275 'unnumber':24 'valley':165 'view':2 'wake':107 'war':371 'wash':181 'watch':28 'water':187 'wed':223 'went':77 'whenev':249 'white':309 'whose':42,210 'window':6,33 'women':219 'wooden':231 'work':189 'year':169 'yellow':121
1036	Storm Windows	309		\nPeople are putting up storm windows now,  Or were, this morning, until the heavy rain  Drove them indoors. So, coming home at noon,  I saw storm windows lying on the ground,  Frame-full of rain; through the water and glass I saw the crushed grass, how it seemed to stream  Away in lines like seaweed on the tide Or blades of wheat leaning under the wind. The ripple and splash of rain on the blurred glass  Seemed that it briefly said, as I walked by,  Something I should have liked to say to you, Something ... the dry grass bent under the pane  Brimful of bouncing water ... something of  A swaying clarity which blindly echoes This lonely afternoon of memories And missed desires, while the wintry rain  (Unspeakable, the distance in the mind!) Runs on the standing windows and away. \n	'afternoon':120 'away':54,142 'bent':102 'blade':63 'blind':116 'blur':78 'bounc':108 'briefli':83 'brim':106 'clariti':114 'come':22 'crush':47 'desir':125 'distanc':132 'dri':100 'drove':18 'echo':117 'frame':35 'frame-ful':34 'full':36 'glass':43,79 'grass':48,101 'ground':33 'heavi':16 'home':23 'indoor':20 'lean':66 'lie':30 'like':57,93 'line':56 'lone':119 'memori':122 'mind':135 'miss':124 'morn':13 'noon':25 'pane':105 'peopl':3 'put':5 'rain':17,38,75,129 'rippl':71 'run':136 'said':84 'saw':27,45 'say':95 'seawe':58 'seem':51,80 'someth':89,98,110 'splash':73 'stand':139 'storm':1,7,28 'stream':53 'sway':113 'tide':61 'unspeak':130 'walk':87 'water':41,109 'wheat':65 'wind':69 'window':2,8,29,140 'wintri':128
1037	Between Assassinations	307		\nOld court. Old chain net hanging in frayed links from the rim,   the metal blackboard dented, darker where the ball   for over thirty years has kissed it, the blacktop buckling,   the white lines nearly worn away. Old common ground   where none of the black men warming up before the basket   will answer or even look in my direction when I ask   if I can run too, the chill a mutual understanding,   one of the last we share, letting me join them here,   if nowhere else, by not letting me forget I don’t belong. Old court. Old courtesy, handshake, exchange of names,   in the early days of bussing, between assassinations,   before our quaint welcoming of them had come to seem,   even to ourselves, the haughty overflow of wealth   so thoroughly our own we didn’t need to see it.   Old beautiful delusion in those courtly gestures   that everything now beyond our wanting just to play was out of bounds, and we were free between the white lines   of whatever we assumed we each of us assumed. Old court, old dream dreamed by the weave, the trap,   the backdoor pass. Old fluid legacy, among the others, that conjures even now within our bodies and between them   such a useless, such an intimate forgetting, as in the moment   when you get a step on your defender and can tell exactly by how another man comes at you where your own man is and, without looking, lob the ball   up in the air so perfectly as he arrives that in a single motion he can catch and finger roll it in. Old court. Old dwindling cease fire, with no hope of peace,   that we silently turn away from when the game is over,   hurrying back (as if believing contact meant contagion)   to our separate tribes, to the cleansing fires of what,   despite ourselves, we momentarily forgot: old lore, old news, old burning certitudes we can’t   stoke high or hot enough, yet won’t stop ever stoking   until whatever it is we think we are anneals and toughens into an impenetrable shield.\n	'air':252 'among':195 'anneal':345 'anoth':233 'answer':54 'arriv':257 'ask':63 'assassin':2,112 'assum':173,178 'away':38,286 'back':294 'backdoor':190 'ball':22,248 'basket':52 'beauti':143 'believ':297 'belong':96 'beyond':152 'black':46 'blackboard':17 'blacktop':31 'bodi':204 'bound':161 'buckl':32 'burn':321 'buss':110 'catch':265 'ceas':275 'certitud':322 'chain':6 'chill':70 'cleans':307 'come':120,235 'common':40 'conjur':199 'contact':298 'contagion':300 'court':4,98,147,180,272 'courtesi':100 'darker':19 'day':108 'defend':226 'delus':144 'dent':18 'despit':311 'didn':136 'direct':60 'dream':182,183 'dwindl':274 'earli':107 'els':87 'enough':330 'even':56,123,200 'ever':335 'everyth':150 'exact':230 'exchang':102 'finger':267 'fire':276,308 'fluid':193 'forget':92,214 'forgot':315 'fray':10 'free':165 'game':290 'gestur':148 'get':221 'ground':41 'handshak':101 'hang':8 'haughti':127 'high':327 'hope':279 'hot':329 'hurri':293 'impenetr':350 'intim':213 'join':82 'kiss':28 'last':77 'legaci':194 'let':80,90 'line':35,169 'link':11 'lob':246 'look':57,245 'lore':317 'man':234,241 'meant':299 'men':47 'metal':16 'moment':218 'momentarili':314 'motion':262 'mutual':72 'name':104 'near':36 'need':138 'net':7 'news':319 'none':43 'nowher':86 'old':3,5,39,97,99,142,179,181,192,271,273,316,318,320 'one':74 'other':197 'overflow':128 'pass':191 'peac':281 'perfect':254 'play':157 'quaint':115 'rim':14 'roll':268 'run':67 'see':140 'seem':122 'separ':303 'share':79 'shield':351 'silent':284 'singl':261 'step':223 'stoke':326,336 'stop':334 'tell':229 'think':342 'thirti':25 'thorough':132 'toughen':347 'trap':188 'tribe':304 'turn':285 'understand':73 'us':177 'useless':210 'want':154 'warm':48 'wealth':130 'weav':186 'welcom':116 'whatev':171,338 'white':34,168 'within':202 'without':244 'won':332 'worn':37 'year':26 'yet':331
1038	Writing	309		\nThe cursive crawl, the squared-off characters  these by themselves delight, even without  a meaning, in a foreign language, in Chinese, for instance, or when skaters curve  all day across the lake, scoring their white  records in ice. Being intelligible, these winding ways with their audacities  and delicate hesitations, they become  miraculous, so intimately, out there at the pen’s point or brush’s tip, do world  and spirit wed. The small bones of the wrist  balance against great skeletons of stars  exactly; the blind bat surveys his way  by echo alone. Still, the point of style  is character. The universe induces a different tremor in every hand, from the  check-forger’s to that of the Emperor Hui Tsung, who called his own calligraphy  the ‘Slender Gold.’ A nervous man writes nervously of a nervous world, and so on. Miraculous. It is as though the world were a great writing. Having said so much,  let us allow there is more to the world  than writing: continental faults are not  bare convoluted fissures in the brain.  Not only must the skaters soon go home;  also the hard inscription of their skates is scored across the open water, which long  remembers nothing, neither wind nor wake.\n	'across':32,197 'allow':161 'alon':94 'also':188 'audac':48 'balanc':79 'bare':174 'bat':88 'becom':53 'blind':87 'bone':75 'brain':179 'brush':65 'call':125 'calligraphi':128 'charact':9,101 'check':114 'check-forg':113 'chines':23 'continent':170 'convolut':175 'crawl':4 'cursiv':3 'curv':29 'day':31 'delic':50 'delight':13 'differ':106 'echo':93 'emperor':121 'even':14 'everi':109 'exact':85 'fault':171 'fissur':176 'foreign':20 'forger':115 'go':186 'gold':131 'great':81,153 'hand':110 'hard':190 'hesit':51 'home':187 'hui':122 'ice':40 'induc':104 'inscript':191 'instanc':25 'intellig':42 'intim':56 'lake':34 'languag':21 'let':159 'long':202 'man':134 'mean':17 'miracul':54,144 'much':158 'must':182 'neither':205 'nervous':133,136,139 'noth':204 'open':199 'pen':61 'point':63,97 'record':38 'rememb':203 'said':156 'score':35,196 'skate':194 'skater':28,184 'skeleton':82 'slender':130 'small':74 'soon':185 'spirit':71 'squar':7 'squared-off':6 'star':84 'still':95 'style':99 'survey':89 'though':148 'tip':67 'tremor':107 'tsung':123 'univers':103 'us':160 'wake':208 'water':200 'way':45,91 'wed':72 'white':37 'wind':44,206 'without':15 'world':69,140,150,167 'wrist':78 'write':1,135,154,169
1039	Money	309		\nThis morning we shall spend a few minutes  Upon the study of symbolism, which is basic  To the nature of money. I show you this nickel.  Icons and cryptograms are written all over The nickel: one side shows a hunchbacked bison  Bending his head and curling his tail to accommodate  The circular nature of money. Over him arches UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and, squinched in  Between that and his rump, E PLURIBUS UNUM, A Roman reminiscence that appears to mean  An indeterminately large number of things  All of which are the same. Under the bison A straight line giving him a ground to stand on  Reads FIVE CENTS. And on the other side of our nickel  There is the profile of a man with long hair  And a couple of feathers in the hair; we know  Somehow that he is an American Indian, and  He wears the number nineteen-thirty-six. Right in front of his eyes the word LIBERTY, bent  To conform with the curve of the rim, appears  To be falling out of the sky Y first; the Indian  Keeps his eyes downcast and does not notice this;  To notice it, indeed, would be shortsighted of him.  So much for the iconography of one of our nickels,  Which is now becoming a rarity and something of  A collectors’ item: for as a matter of fact There is almost nothing you can buy with a nickel,  The representative American Indian was destroyed  A hundred years or so ago, and his descendants’  Relations with liberty are maintained with reservations,  Or primitive concentration camps; while the bison,  Except for a few examples kept in cages, Is now extinct. Something like that, I think, Is what Keats must have meant in his celebrated  Ode on a Grecian Urn.                                Notice, in conclusion, A number of circumstances sometimes overlooked  Even by experts: (a) Indian and bison, Confined to obverse and reverse of the coin,  Can never see each other; (b) they are looking  In opposite directions, the bison past The Indian’s feathers, the Indian past The bison’s tail; (c) they are upside down To one another; (d) the bison has a human face  Somewhat resembling that of Jupiter Ammon. I hope that our studies today will have shown you  Something of the import of symbolism With respect to the understanding of what is symbolized.\n	'accommod':51 'ago':251 'almost':232 'america':63 'american':143,242 'ammon':369 'anoth':356 'appear':79,172 'arch':59 'b':328 'basic':17 'becom':215 'bend':43 'bent':163 'bison':42,96,268,314,336,346,359 'buy':236 'c':349 'cage':276 'camp':265 'celebr':293 'cent':109 'circular':53 'circumst':305 'coin':322 'collector':222 'concentr':264 'conclus':301 'confin':315 'conform':165 'coupl':130 'cryptogram':30 'curl':47 'curv':168 'd':357 'descend':254 'destroy':245 'direct':334 'downcast':187 'e':72 'even':308 'exampl':273 'except':269 'expert':310 'extinct':279 'eye':159,186 'face':363 'fact':229 'fall':175 'feather':132,341 'first':181 'five':108 'front':156 'give':100 'grecian':297 'ground':103 'hair':127,135 'head':45 'hope':371 'human':362 'hunchback':41 'hundr':247 'icon':28 'iconographi':206 'import':383 'inde':196 'indetermin':83 'indian':144,183,243,312,339,343 'item':223 'jupit':368 'keat':287 'keep':184 'kept':274 'know':137 'larg':84 'liberti':162,257 'like':281 'line':99 'long':126 'look':331 'maintain':259 'man':124 'matter':227 'mean':81 'meant':290 'minut':9 'money':1,22,56 'morn':3 'much':203 'must':288 'natur':20,54 'never':324 'nickel':27,36,117,211,239 'nineteen':151 'nineteen-thirty-six':150 'noth':233 'notic':191,194,299 'number':85,149,303 'obvers':317 'ode':294 'one':37,208,355 'opposit':333 'overlook':307 'past':337,344 'pluribus':73 'primit':263 'profil':121 'rariti':217 'read':107 'relat':255 'reminisc':77 'repres':241 'resembl':365 'reserv':261 'respect':387 'revers':319 'right':154 'rim':171 'roman':76 'rump':71 'see':325 'shall':5 'shortsight':199 'show':24,39 'shown':378 'side':38,114 'six':153 'sky':179 'somehow':138 'someth':219,280,380 'sometim':306 'somewhat':364 'spend':6 'squinch':65 'stand':105 'state':61 'straight':98 'studi':12,374 'symbol':14,385,394 'tail':49,348 'thing':87 'think':284 'thirti':152 'today':375 'understand':390 'unit':60 'unum':74 'upon':10 'upsid':352 'urn':298 'wear':147 'word':161 'would':197 'written':32 'y':180 'year':248
1040	Rock Pool	307		\n1 Water roared everywhere around us, yet from the bank  all we could see of it were quick spumes and flashes  here and there, in among the boulders. Cautiously,  as if they might awaken, we clambered over  the gigantic slabs and humps, the sun-baked ovals  lumpy as hammered clay, and saw downstream below us  only the vague shapes of others, almost billowy,  like magnified amoebas, stretching away to even  vaguer ones beyond them, turning the narrow  streambed through the valley to a lunar seam.        2 Easing ourselves down over the massive sides (we were hot and tired, eager for the pools below)  we could make out older water in the rough grain,  undulating and immobile currents, band swirled on band,  mica-speckled, cloudy, each seeming to move off,  as it faded, through the stone—each one a glacial rune,  each boulder an innumerable pebble in the ice sheet’s tidal suck and drag: two hundred thousand years,  two billion, five, the molten core, spoor  of gasses in the vast night, at our fingertips.        3 Then the pool: your clothes shed, with one hand braced  against the rock ledge you had slipped into the hip-high  rushing water, and were wading out, bent over, reaching  like the blind before you for the slippery boulder you slid across, pushing against the white weight of the pouring mist, your skin goose-fleshed, speckled  bright as mica, and then, part mist yourself, you turned back, smiling, calling though I couldn’t  hear you, calling and waving for me to climb down  to where you were, to join you there. And so I did.\n	'1':3 '2':89 '3':179 'across':222 'almost':65 'amoeba':69 'among':28 'around':7 'awaken':36 'away':71 'back':248 'bake':48 'band':121,124 'bank':12 'bent':208 'beyond':76 'billion':164 'billowi':66 'blind':213 'boulder':30,146,219 'brace':189 'bright':238 'call':250,257 'cautious':31 'clamber':38 'clay':53 'climb':263 'cloth':184 'cloudi':128 'core':168 'could':15,108 'couldn':253 'current':120 'downstream':56 'drag':158 'eager':102 'eas':90 'even':73 'everywher':6 'fade':136 'fingertip':178 'five':165 'flash':23 'flesh':236 'gass':171 'gigant':41 'glacial':143 'goos':235 'goose-flesh':234 'grain':116 'hammer':52 'hand':188 'hear':255 'high':201 'hip':200 'hip-high':199 'hot':99 'hump':44 'hundr':160 'ice':152 'immobil':119 'innumer':148 'join':270 'ledg':193 'like':67,211 'lumpi':50 'lunar':87 'magnifi':68 'make':109 'massiv':95 'mica':126,240 'mica-speckl':125 'might':35 'mist':231,244 'molten':167 'move':132 'narrow':80 'night':175 'older':111 'one':75,141,187 'other':64 'oval':49 'part':243 'pebbl':149 'pool':2,105,182 'pour':230 'push':223 'quick':20 'reach':210 'roar':5 'rock':1,192 'rough':115 'rune':144 'rush':202 'saw':55 'seam':88 'see':16 'seem':130 'shape':62 'shed':185 'sheet':153 'side':96 'skin':233 'slab':42 'slid':221 'slip':196 'slipperi':218 'smile':249 'speckl':127,237 'spoor':169 'spume':21 'stone':139 'streamb':81 'stretch':70 'suck':156 'sun':47 'sun-bak':46 'swirl':122 'though':251 'thousand':161 'tidal':155 'tire':101 'turn':78,247 'two':159,163 'undul':117 'us':8,58 'vagu':61 'vaguer':74 'valley':84 'vast':174 'wade':206 'water':4,112,203 'wave':259 'weight':227 'white':226 'year':162 'yet':9
1041	The Dependencies	309		\nThis morning, between two branches of a tree  Beside the door, epeira once again Has spun and signed his tapestry and trap.  I test his early-warning system and It works, he scrambles forth in sable with  The yellow hieroglyph that no one knows  The meaning of. And I remember now How yesterday at dusk the nighthawks came  Back as they do about this time each year, Grey squadrons with the slashes white on wings  Cruising for bugs beneath the bellied cloud.  Now soon the monarchs will be drifting south,  And then the geese will go, and then one day  The little garden birds will not be here.  See how many leaves already have Withered and turned; a few have fallen, too.  Change is continuous on the seamless web,  Yet moments come like this one, when you feel  Upon your heart a signal to attend The definite announcement of an end Where one thing ceases and another starts;  When like the spider waiting on the web  You know the intricate dependencies  Spreading in secret through the fabric vast  Of heaven and earth, sending their messages  Ciphered in chemistry to all the kinds, The whisper down the bloodstream: it is time.\n	'alreadi':116 'announc':151 'anoth':160 'attend':148 'back':62 'belli':84 'beneath':82 'besid':11 'bird':107 'bloodstream':200 'branch':7 'bug':81 'came':61 'ceas':158 'chang':126 'chemistri':191 'cipher':189 'cloud':85 'come':135 'continu':128 'cruis':79 'day':103 'definit':150 'depend':2,174 'door':13 'drift':92 'dusk':58 'earli':29 'early-warn':28 'earth':185 'end':154 'epeira':14 'fabric':180 'fallen':124 'feel':141 'forth':37 'garden':106 'gees':97 'go':99 'grey':71 'heart':144 'heaven':183 'hieroglyph':43 'intric':173 'kind':195 'know':47,171 'leav':115 'like':136,163 'littl':105 'mani':114 'mean':49 'messag':188 'moment':134 'monarch':89 'morn':4 'nighthawk':60 'one':46,102,138,156 'rememb':53 'sabl':39 'scrambl':36 'seamless':131 'secret':177 'see':112 'send':186 'sign':20 'signal':146 'slash':75 'soon':87 'south':93 'spider':165 'spread':175 'spun':18 'squadron':72 'start':161 'system':31 'tapestri':22 'test':26 'thing':157 'time':68,203 'trap':24 'tree':10 'turn':120 'two':6 'upon':142 'vast':181 'wait':166 'warn':30 'web':132,169 'whisper':197 'white':76 'wing':78 'wither':118 'work':34 'year':70 'yellow':42 'yesterday':56 'yet':133
1042	The Brief Journey West	309		\nBy the dry road the fathers cough and spit, This is their room. They are the ones who hung  That bloody sun upon the southern wall  And crushed the armored beetle to the floor. The father’s skin is seamed and dry, the map Of that wild region where they drained the swamp  And set provision out that they might sit, Of history the cracked precipitate, Until the glass be shattered and the sun  Descend to burn the prosperous flesh away  Of the filthy world, so vilely fathered on  The fathers, such black cinders, sitting there. Old pioneers, what lecheries remain? When schoolgirls pass, what whispers of their skirts,  Cold gleams of flesh, solicit in your veined And gemlike eyes the custom of desire? None now. Their eyes are sunk in ancient flesh,  And the sarcastic triumph of the mind They now enjoy, letting their lust alone  Who may have kin but have no longer kind. Neither tomorrow’s monstrous tumor nor  The reformation of the past they wish,  Who hold in silent colloquy the world  A shrivelled apple in the hand of God. They hang at night their somber flags aloft, And through the amorous dark pursue their theme  Of common images, that sleep may show  Them done with all disasters but the one.\n	'aloft':196 'alon':151 'amor':200 'ancient':136 'appl':183 'armor':34 'away':85 'beetl':35 'black':97 'bloodi':25 'brief':2 'burn':81 'cinder':98 'cold':114 'colloquy':178 'common':206 'cough':11 'crack':69 'crush':32 'custom':126 'dark':201 'descend':79 'desir':128 'disast':216 'done':213 'drain':55 'dri':7,46 'enjoy':147 'eye':124,132 'father':10,40,92,95 'filthi':88 'flag':195 'flesh':84,117,137 'floor':38 'gemlik':123 'glass':73 'gleam':115 'god':188 'hand':186 'hang':190 'histori':67 'hold':175 'hung':23 'imag':207 'journey':3 'kin':155 'kind':160 'lecheri':104 'let':148 'longer':159 'lust':150 'map':48 'may':153,210 'might':64 'mind':144 'monstrous':164 'neither':161 'night':192 'none':129 'old':101 'one':21,219 'pass':108 'past':171 'pioneer':102 'precipit':70 'prosper':83 'provis':60 'pursu':202 'reform':168 'region':52 'remain':105 'road':8 'room':17 'sarcast':140 'schoolgirl':107 'seam':44 'set':59 'shatter':75 'show':211 'shrivel':182 'silent':177 'sit':65,99 'skin':42 'skirt':113 'sleep':209 'solicit':118 'somber':194 'southern':29 'spit':13 'sun':26,78 'sunk':134 'swamp':57 'theme':204 'tomorrow':162 'triumph':141 'tumor':165 'upon':27 'vein':121 'vile':91 'wall':30 'west':4 'whisper':110 'wild':51 'wish':173 'world':89,180
1043	The Goose Fish	309		\nOn the long shore, lit by the moon   To show them properly alone,   Two lovers suddenly embraced   So that their shadows were as one.   The ordinary night was graced For them by the swift tide of blood   That silently they took at flood,   And for a little time they prized    Themselves emparadised. Then, as if shaken by stage-fright   Beneath the hard moon’s bony light,   They stood together on the sand   Embarrassed in each other’s sight   But still conspiring hand in hand,   Until they saw, there underfoot, As though the world had found them out,   The goose fish turning up, though dead,    His hugely grinning head. There in the china light he lay,   Most ancient and corrupt and grey.   They hesitated at his smile, Wondering what it seemed to say To lovers who a little while Before had thought to understand,   By violence upon the sand, The only way that could be known      To make a world their own. It was a wide and moony grin Together peaceful and obscene; They knew not what he would express,   So finished a comedian He might mean failure or success,   But took it for an emblem of Their sudden, new and guilty love To be observed by, when they kissed,      That rigid optimist. So he became their patriarch, Dreadfully mild in the half-dark. His throat that the sand seemed to choke,   His picket teeth, these left their mark   But never did explain the joke That so amused him, lying there While the moon went down to disappear   Along the still and tilted track    That bears the zodiac.\n	'alon':16 'along':263 'amus':252 'ancient':121 'bear':270 'becam':219 'beneath':64 'blood':40 'boni':69 'china':116 'choke':236 'comedian':187 'conspir':85 'corrupt':123 'could':157 'dark':228 'dead':108 'disappear':262 'dread':222 'embarrass':77 'emblem':199 'embrac':20 'emparadis':55 'explain':247 'express':183 'failur':191 'finish':185 'fish':3,104 'flood':46 'found':99 'fright':63 'goos':2,103 'grace':32 'grey':125 'grin':111,172 'guilti':205 'half':227 'half-dark':226 'hand':86,88 'hard':66 'head':112 'hesit':127 'huge':110 'joke':249 'kiss':213 'knew':178 'known':159 'lay':119 'left':241 'lie':254 'light':70,117 'lit':8 'littl':50,141 'long':6 'love':206 'lover':18,138 'make':161 'mark':243 'mean':190 'might':189 'mild':223 'moon':11,67,258 'mooni':171 'never':245 'new':203 'night':30 'obscen':176 'observ':209 'one':27 'optimist':216 'ordinari':29 'patriarch':221 'peac':174 'picket':238 'prize':53 'proper':15 'rigid':215 'sand':76,152,233 'saw':91 'say':136 'seem':134,234 'shadow':24 'shaken':59 'shore':7 'show':13 'sight':82 'silent':42 'smile':130 'stage':62 'stage-fright':61 'still':84,265 'stood':72 'success':193 'sudden':19,202 'swift':37 'teeth':239 'though':95,107 'thought':145 'throat':230 'tide':38 'tilt':267 'time':51 'togeth':73,173 'took':44,195 'track':268 'turn':105 'two':17 'underfoot':93 'understand':147 'upon':150 'violenc':149 'way':155 'went':259 'wide':169 'wonder':131 'world':97,163 'would':182 'zodiac':272
1044	In the Kingdom of Pleasure	307		\nUnwitting accomplice in the scheme of law  she thought to violate, man-set as it was,  and, here, inconsequential as the sun  at midnight, drought at flood-time— when she heard a baby in the tall reeds  at the river’s brink, she was nobody’s  daughter, subject of no rule but the one his need for her established  as she knelt down to quell his crying  with a little tune just seeing him there  had taught her how to hum.                                         Now as then, it is the same tune, timelessly in time,  your mother hums as she kneels down  beside your little barge of foam, smiling to see you smile when she wrings out from the sponge a ragged string  of water over the chest and belly,  the dimpled loins, the bud so far  from flowering, and the foot slick as a fish your hand tries to hold up till it slips back splashing with such mild turbulence that she laughs,  and you laugh to see her laugh. Here now, as it was then, it is still so many years before the blood’s smeared  over doorposts, before the Nile clots  with the first-born, and the women  wailing,wailing throughout the city; here now again is the kingdom of pleasure,  where they are safe still, mother and child,  from the chartered rod of the Fathers,  and where a father can still pray, Lord,  Jealous Chooser, Devouring Law, keep  away from them, just keep away.\n	'accomplic':7 'away':248,253 'babi':40 'back':160 'barg':110 'belli':134 'besid':107 'blood':190 'born':203 'brink':49 'bud':139 'charter':230 'chest':132 'child':227 'chooser':244 'citi':211 'clot':198 'cri':74 'daughter':54 'devour':245 'dimpl':136 'doorpost':194 'drought':31 'establish':66 'far':141 'father':234,238 'first':202 'first-born':201 'fish':150 'flood':34 'flood-tim':33 'flower':143 'foam':112 'foot':146 'hand':152 'heard':38 'hold':155 'hum':88,102 'inconsequenti':25 'jealous':243 'keep':247,252 'kingdom':3,217 'kneel':105 'knelt':69 'laugh':168,171,175 'law':12,246 'littl':77,109 'loin':137 'lord':242 'man':18 'man-set':17 'mani':186 'midnight':30 'mild':164 'mother':101,225 'need':63 'nile':197 'nobodi':52 'one':61 'pleasur':5,219 'pray':241 'quell':72 'rag':126 'reed':44 'river':47 'rod':231 'rule':58 'safe':223 'scheme':10 'see':80,115,173 'set':19 'slick':147 'slip':159 'smear':192 'smile':113,117 'splash':161 'spong':124 'still':184,224,240 'string':127 'subject':55 'sun':28 'tall':43 'taught':84 'thought':14 'throughout':209 'till':157 'time':35,99 'timeless':97 'tri':153 'tune':78,96 'turbul':165 'unwit':6 'violat':16 'wail':207,208 'water':129 'women':206 'wring':120 'year':187
1045	The Icehouse in Summer	309		\nA door sunk in a hillside, with a bolt thick as the boy’s arm, and behind that door  the walls of ice, melting a blue, faint light,  an air of cedar branches, sawdust, fern:  decaying seasons keeping from decay. A summer guest, the boy had never seen  (a servant told him of it) how the lake froze three foot thick, how farmers came with teams,  with axe and saw, to cut great blocks of ice,  translucid, marbled, glittering in the sun,  load them on sleds and drag them up the hill  to be manhandled down the narrow path  and set in courses for the summer’s keeping,  the kitchen uses and luxuriousness of the great houses. And he heard how once a team and driver drowned in the break of spring:  the man’s cry melting from the ice that summer  frightened the sherbet-eaters off the terrace. Dust of the cedar, lost and evergreen  among the slowly blunting water walls where the blade edge melted and the steel saw’s bite  was rounded out, and the horse and rider drowned in the red sea’s blood, I was the silly child who dreamed that riderless cry, and saw the guests run from a ghostly wall, so long before the winter house fell with the summer house, and the houses, Egypt, the great houses, had an end.\n	'air':34 'among':162 'arm':19 'axe':72 'behind':21 'bite':178 'blade':170 'block':78 'blood':193 'blue':30 'blunt':165 'bolt':13 'boy':17,49 'branch':37 'break':134 'came':68 'cedar':36,158 'child':198 'cours':107 'cri':140,203 'cut':76 'decay':40,44 'door':6,23 'drag':92 'dream':200 'driver':130 'drown':131,187 'dust':155 'eater':151 'edg':171 'egypt':227 'end':233 'evergreen':161 'faint':31 'farmer':67 'fell':219 'fern':39 'foot':64 'frighten':147 'froze':62 'ghost':211 'glitter':83 'great':77,120,229 'guest':47,207 'heard':124 'hill':96 'hillsid':10 'hors':184 'hous':121,218,223,226,230 'ice':27,80,144 'icehous':2 'keep':42,112 'kitchen':114 'lake':61 'light':32 'load':87 'long':214 'lost':159 'luxuri':117 'man':138 'manhandl':99 'marbl':82 'melt':28,141,172 'narrow':102 'never':51 'path':103 'red':190 'rider':186 'riderless':202 'round':180 'run':208 'saw':74,176,205 'sawdust':38 'sea':191 'season':41 'seen':52 'servant':54 'set':105 'sherbet':150 'sherbet-eat':149 'silli':197 'sled':90 'slowli':164 'spring':136 'steel':175 'summer':4,46,110,146,222 'sun':86 'sunk':7 'team':70,128 'terrac':154 'thick':14,65 'three':63 'told':55 'translucid':81 'use':115 'wall':25,167,212 'water':166 'winter':217
